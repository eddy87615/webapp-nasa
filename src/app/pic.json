The vehicle simulator duplicated the portion of the vehicle skin that contained the umbilical connections and personnel access hatches. Driven by a hydraulic servo system, the vehicle simulator produced relative motion between the vehicle and tower. On the Arm Farm, extreme environmental conditions (such as a launch scrub during an approaching Florida thunderstorm) could be simulated.

            "description": "The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) played a crucial role in the development of the huge Saturn rockets that delivered humans to the moon in the 1960s.  Many unique facilities existed at MSFC for the development and testing of the Saturn rockets.  Affectionately nicknamed “The Arm Farm”, the Random Motion/ Lift-Off Simulator was one of those unique facilities. This facility was developed to test the swingarm mechanisms that were used to hold the rocket in position until lift-off. The Arm Farm provided the capability of testing the detachment and reconnection of various arms under brutally realistic conditions.  The 18-acre facility consisted of more than a half dozen arm test positions and one position for testing access arms used by the Apollo astronauts. Each test position had two elements: a vehicle simulator for duplicating motions during countdown and launch; and a section duplicating the launch tower. The vehicle simulator duplicated the portion of the vehicle skin that contained the umbilical connections and personnel access hatches. Driven by a hydraulic servo system, the vehicle simulator produced relative motion between the vehicle and tower. On the Arm Farm, extreme environmental conditions (such as a launch scrub during an approaching Florida thunderstorm) could be simulated. The dramatic scenes that the Marshall engineers and technicians created at the Arm Farm permitted the gathering of crucial technical and engineering data to ensure a successful real time launch from the Kennedy Space Center.

            "description": "On Sept. 7, 2023, during its 54th close flyby of Jupiter, NASA's Juno mission captured this view of an area in the giant planet's far northern regions called Jet N7. The image shows turbulent clouds and storms along Jupiter's terminator, the dividing line between the day and night sides of the planet. The low angle of sunlight highlights the complex topography of features in this region, which scientists have studied to better understand the processes playing out in Jupiter's atmosphere.  As often occurs in views from Juno, Jupiter's clouds in this picture lend themselves to pareidolia, the effect that causes observers to perceive faces or other patterns in largely random patterns.  Citizen scientist Vladimir Tarasov made this image using raw data from the JunoCam instrument. At the time the raw image was taken, the Juno spacecraft was about 4,800 miles (about 7,700 kilometers) above Jupiter's cloud tops, at a latitude of about 69 degrees north.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25727",

Halsell, Jr., mission commander, uses a Hi-8mm camcorder to videotape the Hand Held Diffusion Test Cells (HHDTC), in the Spacelab Module aboard the Earth-orbiting Space Shuttle Columbia.  Each test cell has three chambers containing a protein solution, a buffer solution and a precipitant solution chamber.  Using the liquid-liquid diffusion method, the different fluids are brought into contact but not mixed.  Over a period of time, the fluids will diffuse into each other through the random motion of molecules.  The gradual increase in concentration of the precipitant within the protein solution causes the proteins to crystallize."

The top consists of the launch abort tower, crew module, service module and spacecraft adaptor.  Shakers will impose random loads/vibrations to determine the flight test vehicle’s first several bending modes and the strategically located sensors throughout the stacks will measure the amount, acceleration and direction of movement. The purpose of the testing is to confirm that Ares I-X will behave as predicted as it lifts off the pad and powers through the initial stage of flight in a demonstration flight later this year.

Accelerometers and strain gages have been attached to Orion in various locations. During a series of tests, each lasting only 30 seconds, Orion will be subjected to gradually increasing levels of vibrations that represent levels the vehicle would experience during launch, orbit and descent. The data is reviewed in order to assess the health of the crew module.    Orion is the exploration spacecraft designed to carry astronauts to destinations not yet explored by humans, including an asteroid and Mars. It will have emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during space travel and provide safe re-entry from deep space return velocities. The first unpiloted test flight of the Orion is scheduled to launch later this year atop a Delta IV rocket and in 2017 on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket.

            "description": "After blasting off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in November 2004, NASA's Swift spacecraft wasted no time in getting down to the business of spotting gamma-ray bursts.  Just after opening its doors in December, Swift detected a flurry of bursts.  Scientists were still calibrating the main instrument -- the Burst Alert Telescope -- when the first burst appeared on Dec. 17.  They witnessed four more over the following few days, leading scientists to wonder if they previously underestimated the true rate at which these powerful events occur.  Swift's primary goal is to unravel the mystery of these random and fleeting explosions.  Once all three instruments onboard are turned on and calibrated, they can begin analyzing the bursts.  Swift's three telescopes are designed to work together to quickly pinpoint gamma-ray bursts and observe their afterglows in the gamma-ray, X-ray and optical wavebands.  During its two-year mission, Swift is expected to observe more than 200 bursts and afterglows, which will represent the most comprehensive study of gamma-ray burst afterglow to date."

In reality, Epimetheus and the rings both orbit in Saturn's equatorial plane.  Inner moons and rings orbit very near the equatorial plane of each of the four giant planets in our solar system, but more distant moons can have orbits wildly out of the equatorial plane. It has been theorized that the highly inclined orbits of the outer, distant moons are remnants of the random directions from which they approached the planets they orbit.  This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about -0.3 degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 26, 2015.  The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 500,000 miles (800,000 kilometers) from Epimetheus and at a Sun-Epimetheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 62 degrees. Image scale is 3 miles (5 kilometers) per pixel.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA18342"

            "description": "S89-39195 (July 1989) --- This is the crew patch for STS-33, designed by the five crew members. It features a stylized falcon soaring into space to represent America's commitment to manned spaceflight. The crew members feel the falcon symbolizes courage, intelligence, tenacity, and love of flight. They intend the orbit around Earth to represent the falcon's lofty domain; however, the bird, with its keen vision and natural curiosity, is depicted looking forward beyond that domain to challenge the edge of the universe. The bold red feathers of the wings drawn from the American flag overlaying the random field of stars illustrate the determination to expand the boundaries of knowledge by American presence in space. The single gold star on a field of blue honors the memory of the late Rear Admiral S. David Griggs, originally assigned to this crew.     The NASA insignia design for space shuttle flights is reserved for use by the astronauts and for other official use as the NASA Administrator may authorize. Public availability has been approved only in the forms of illustrations by the various news media. When and if there is any change in this policy, which is not anticipated, the change will be publicly announced. Photo credit: NASA"

            "description": "Dan Sokolowski worked as an engineering coop student at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lewis Research Center from 1962 to 1966 while earning his Mechanical Engineering degree from Purdue. At the time of this photograph Sokolowski had just been hired as a permanent NASA employee in the Chemical Rocket Evaluation Branch of the Chemical Rocket Division. He had also just won a regional American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics competition for his paper on high and low-frequency combustion instability.     The resolution of the low-frequency combustion instability, or chugging, in liquid hydrogen rocket systems was one of Lewis’ more significant feats of the early 1960s. In most rocket engine combustion chambers, the pressure, temperature, and flows are in constant flux. The engine is considered to be operating normally if the fluctuations remain random and within certain limits. Lewis researchers used high-speed photography to study and define Pratt and Whitney’s RL-10’s combustion instability by throttling the engine under the simulated flight conditions. They found that the injection of a small stream of helium gas into the liquid-oxygen tank immediately stabilized the system.   Sokolowski’s later work focused on combustion in airbreathing engines. In 1983 was named Manager of a multidisciplinary program aimed at improving durability of combustor and turbine components. After 39 years Sokolowski retired from NASA in September 2002."

            "description": "STS083-747-033 (4-8 April 1997) --- Center Pivot Irrigation, in Saudi Arabia.  This irrigation project in Saudi Arabia is typical of many isolated irrigation projects scattered throughout the arid and hyper-arid regions of the Earth.  Fossil water is mined from depths as great as 3,000 feet, pumped to the surface, and distributed via large center pivot irrigation feeds.  The circles of green irrigated vegetation may comprise a variety of agricultural commodities from alfalfa to wheat.  Diameters of the normally circular fields range from a few hundred meters to as much as 2 miles.  The projects often trace out a narrow, sinuous, and seemingly random path.  Actually, engineers generally seek ancient river channels now buried by the sand seas.  The fossil waters mined in these projects accumulated during periods of wetter climate in the Pleistocene glacial epochs, between 10,000 to 2 million years ago, and are not being replenished under current climatic conditions.  The projects, therefore, will have limited production as the reservoirs are drained.  Water, of course, is the key to agriculture in Saudi Arabia.  The Kingdom has implemented a multifaceted program to provide the vast supplies of water necessary to achieve the spectacular growth of the agricultural sector.  A network of dams has been built to trap and utilize precious seasonal floods.  Vast underground water reservoirs have been tapped through deep wells.  Desalination plants have been built to produce fresh water from the sea for urban and industrial use, thereby freeing other sources for agriculture.  Facilities have also been put into place to treat urban and industrial run-off for agricultural irrigation.  These efforts collectively have helped transform vast tracts of the desert into fertile farmland.  Land under cultivation has grown from under 400,000 acres in 1976 to more than 8 million acres in 1993."

            "description": "Not all galaxies have the luxury of possessing a simple moniker or quirky nickname.   This impressive galaxy imaged by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is one of the unlucky ones, and goes by a name that looks more like a password for a computer:  2XMM J143450.5+033843.  Such a name may seem like a random jumble of numbers and letters, but like all galactic epithets it has a distinct meaning. This galaxy, for example, was detected and observed as part of the second X-ray sky survey performed by ESA’s XMM-Newton Observatory. Its celestial coordinates form the rest of the bulky name, following the “J”: a right ascension value of 14h (hours) 34m (minutes) 50.5s (seconds). This can be likened to terrestrial longitude. It also has a declination of +03d (degrees) 38m (minutes) 43s (seconds). Declination can be likened to terrestrial latitude. The other fuzzy object in the frame was named in the same way — it is a bright galaxy named 2XMM J143448.3+033749.  2XMM J143450.5+033843 lies nearly 400 million light-years away from Earth. It is a Seyfert galaxy that is dominated by something known as an Active Galactic Nucleus — its core is thought to contain a supermassive black hole that is emitting huge amounts of radiation, pouring energetic X-rays out into the Universe.

            "description": "Cassini gazed toward high southern latitudes near Saturn's south pole to observe ghostly curtains of dancing light -- Saturn's southern auroras, or southern lights. These natural light displays at the planet's poles are created by charged particles raining down into the upper atmosphere, making gases there glow.  The dark area at the top of this scene is Saturn's night side. The auroras rotate from left to right, curving around the planet as Saturn rotates over about 70 minutes, compressed here into a movie sequence of about five seconds.  Background stars are seen sliding behind the planet. Cassini was moving around Saturn during the observation, keeping its gaze fixed on a particular spot on the planet, which causes a shift in the distant background over the course of the observation.  Some of the stars seem to make a slight turn to the right just before disappearing. This effect is due to refraction -- the starlight gets bent as it passes through the atmosphere, which acts as a lens.  Random bright specks and streaks appearing from frame to frame are due to charged particles and cosmic rays hitting the camera detector.  The aim of this observation was to observe seasonal changes in the brightness of Saturn's auroras, and to compare with the simultaneous observations made by Cassini's infrared and ultraviolet imaging spectrometers.  The original images in this movie sequence have a size of 256x256 pixels; both the original size and a version enlarged to 500x500 pixels are available here. The small image size is the result of a setting on the camera that allows for shorter exposure times than full-size (1024x1024 pixel) images. This enabled Cassini to take more frames in a short time and still capture enough photons from the auroras for them to be visible.  The images were taken in visible light using the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 20, 2017, at a distance of about 620,000 miles (1 million kilometers) from Saturn. The views look toward 74 degrees south latitude on Saturn. Image scale is about 0.9 mile (1.4 kilometers) per pixel on Saturn.

The dramatic scenes that the Marshall engineers and technicians created at the Arm Farm permitted the gathering of crucial technical and engineering data to ensure a successful real time launch from the Kennedy Space Center.

            "description": "California, reveals the devastating effect of California's ongoing drought on Sierra Nevada conifer forests.  The map will be used to help the U.S. Forest Service assess and respond to the impacts of increased tree mortality caused by the drought, particularly where wildlands meet urban areas within the Sierra National Forest.  After several years of extreme drought, the highly stressed conifers (trees or bushes that produce cones and are usually green year-round) of the Sierra Nevada are now more susceptible to bark beetles (Dendroctonus spp.). While bark beetles killing trees in the Sierra Nevada is a natural phenomenon, the scale of mortality in the last couple of years is far greater than previously observed. The U.S. Forest Service is using recent airborne spectroscopic measurements from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument aboard NASA's ER-2 aircraft, together with new advanced algorithms, to quantify this impact over this large region of rugged terrain. The high-altitude ER-2 aircraft is based at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center, Edwards, California.  The image was created by scientists at the USFS's Pacific Southwest Region Remote Sensing Lab, McClellan, California, by performing a time series analysis of AVIRIS images. Scientists evaluated baseline tree mortality on public lands in the summer of 2015 using a machine learning algorithm called \"random forest.\" This algorithm classifies the AVIRIS measurements as dominated by either shrubs, healthy trees or newly dead conifer trees.  To quantify how much the amount of dead vegetation increased during the fall of 2015, the Forest Service scientists conducted an advanced spectral mixture analysis. This analysis evaluates each spectrum to determine the fraction of green vegetation, dead vegetation and soil. The full spectral range of AVIRIS is important to separate the signatures of soil and dead vegetation. To produce this comprehensive Sierra National Forest tree mortality map, the result from the summer of 2015 was evaluated to look for increases of more than 10 percent in dead vegetation during the fall of 2015.  AVIRIS measures spectra of the Earth system to conduct advanced science research. These western U.S. AVIRIS measurements were acquired as part of NASA's Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) preparatory airborne campaign. HyspIRI was one of the space missions suggested to NASA by the National Academy of Sciences in its 2007 decadal survey for Earth Science. In the future, HyspIRI could provide spectral and thermal measurements of this type globally for ecosystem research and additional science objectives.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20717"

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 95, Spaceship Crash Testing, a Crash Course in Space Safety. I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on right here at NASA. So, if you're familiar with us, you may know we've had a couple of episodes about the Orion Spacecraft, the one that will be traveling into deep space, carrying humans. We've covered a variety of topics, a lot of them focusing on the more human side of things. Keeping them alive and comfortable, protecting them from radiation and learning how to deal with emergencies if necessary. That's a lot of human spaceflight, thinking of what could go wrong and then solving the issues ahead of time. And that's what we're going to be talking about today. This topic is called occupant protection. It's basically thinking of ways that Orion could put stresses on the human body during different phases of flight, like launches and landings. And thinking of ways the crew inside could be injured. This could come from vibration, or acceleration, even hard impacts. And then, super smart people get together and design parts of Orion to make sure the crew is safe. So, today, we're talking about the biomechanics of it all and even what biomechanics is with Mark Baldwin. Mark is one of those super smart people helping to solve these issues. He has a background that goes deep into figuring out how to keep people safe. Anatomic modeling, kinetics and kinematics, ergonomics, and crash testing for plane, trains, and automobiles, and now spacecraft. This guys has strapped himself into a vibration table for Orion testing for 7 hours, over the course of two days, all in the name of good engineering. He's an Orion occupant protection specialist for Lockheed Martin. So, here's a crash course on occupant protection and biomechanics with Dr. Mark Baldwin, enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Mark, thank you for calling in all the way from Littleton, Colorado today, I really appreciate your time.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, it's my pleasure.  Host: So, if you're thinking about, and this kind of struck me, if you're thinking about just fun engineering jobs, crash testing has to be up there for something you see and think, yep, that's what I want to do for the rest of my life. Is that kind of how you started with your career, or did you kind of take another path?  Mark Baldwin: No, there was nothing early in my childhood that directed me toward crash testing. But when I was an engineer, I did have an interest in things, how they moved, how they worked, kind of the underlying reasons things functioned. And then, in my undergraduate at Purdue University, I started in mechanical engineering. But I definitely had interest in another aspect of engineering, which was biomechanical engineering. And that is a unique form that really takes mechanics and applies it to the body. It was only later when I got into industry that I got exposure to crash testing and crash test dummies. And it was really interesting. Of course, the first time you see a big test and how fast everything occurs and things flying off or things breaking, you think wow, that was pretty intense. So, that was really the origin of where I am now.  Host: Yeah, it's a very visual thing and it's just super cool to watch. And that's kind of where I wanted to start. You said you started with mechanical engineering and then went into this biomechanical and I kind of wanted to start there. Can you tell me a little bit about what that is, biomechanical engineering and biomechanics?  Mark Baldwin: Sure, yeah. Actually we need to start with mechanics and mechanical engineering, really. And you can break that down into generally three categories. The first would be how things are designed. And that really comes down to the shape of things, the size of things, how things fit together. In spacecraft development, a lot of that comes down to the computer aided design and laying things out. can we fit all this stuff physically into the vehicle? And then there's motion. Things that move, kinematics. On a spacecraft there are lots of things that are actuated. So, either a valve opens, or buttons are pressed, or even pyrotechnics, small explosions that occur to release something. And of course any time you have motions, you're going to have certain loads associated with that motion. And then that gets to the third piece the strength and the stress. So, a lot of people don't know those terms, but in general, that's how a material can withstand external environment. So, what type of load is applied to those parts in the spacecraft. And I'll give you an example. In terms of the human, strength you can think of as how much strength is in your arm. So, let's just take your bicep. If you hold out a platter that has 100 pounds of cookies on it and you're holding that straight in front of you, you can think of I have a certain amount of strength in my arm to support that 100 pounds. Now, stress is a common output we look at in engineering, to see if that part, in this case, our bicep can withstand the amount of load put over that certain area. So, you bicep would be a cross sectional area if you cut your bicep in half. Now, if I'm strong enough to support that 100 pounds. The strength is greater than the stress and I will not see a failure. Now, if I take my son, Dylan, who's 8 and I ask him to hold the same plate of 100 pounds of cookies, now he has a much smaller cross sectional area for his biceps. Same force. And if his arm is the same length, now all of the sudden he has a lot more stress and his arm will fall, and he doesn't have enough strength. So, in that case the stress exceeds the strength. And that's when things break. So, on spacecraft, same kind of thing, when the stress is higher than the strength of the material, or the part, then you can get catastrophic failures. So, it's really those three things. The design, the motion of things, and the strength, and stress. That's all mechanical engineering.  Host: Yeah, it's like if a job needs to be done, what you're doing is basically you're solving that problem. You're trying to figure out what's the best way that I could solve this problem and make sure on the strength and stress side that it's going to be reliable in solving that problem.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And there are multiple teams of people that do these things. So, it's a big collaborative effort. Both on the Lockheed Martin side, and the NASA side to ensure that we're really addressing these three aspects of mechanical engineering. So, then back to your question about biomechanical engineering, that's where it gets interesting. So, in general biomechanics, or biomechanical engineering is, take those same fundamentals of mechanical engineering, and now apply them to the body. The challenge there is that of course there are no parallel or perpendicular surfaces. There are no right angles in the body. All the materials are pretty much nonlinear. And then, people come in different shapes and sizes and different body strengths. So, you're going to have inherent variability. As in everybody is different. So, you can't just apply one set of loads or environments to one person and expect a different person of a different size to be able to withstand that same environment.  Host: Yeah, that makes things a little bit harder, because now you not only have to solve that problem with the mechanical engineering part, now add the human you've got to not only solve the problem, but you have to make sure that the human is going to be okay when the problem is solved. And then that it's flexible enough that you know multiple types of people can survive it, or it works for them, is that right?  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, yeah. And so, then if we look at now applying this whole biomechanical engineering to Orion, specifically and to keeping the astronauts safe, to be able to do all those things we need to look at how to protect the human in a variety of different ways, right? We need to provide surfaces that support them, that limit that motion, and that keep those external environments that are applied to the vehicle to a level sustainable by humans without injury. And that's really the crux of my job. And also what makes it interesting, because then I get to work with a large variety of people, both on the NASA and the Lockheed side. So, that's for example the crew systems team, Lockheed Martin crew system team in Houston designing the seats that maybe the Orion crew survivability systems team, the suit guys at NASA JSC, the human factors folks against stress and other mechanical analysis teams. All that stuff needs to go into what we consider for astronaut safety and assessment of weather an injury is going to occur or not.  Host: So, like for let's take an abort for an example. You're on your way into space and something happens, and the abort system is supposed to carry the crew module away with the people inside safely. So, from a mechanical side, you've got to make sure that it actually pulls it away from a speeding rocket, okay, that's fine. But from the human side, you've got to make sure that it does it in a way where the humans are safe and going to be okay as well as the crew module.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, absolutely. And so, that's the trick of it. Now, we'll get to it later, but that's the whole purpose of our Ascent Abort number 2 test that's coming up later this summer. And really, from that test, it's my job along with others to understand and characterize that environment. Now, keep in mind that's one test. We can collect data on that test, but a real abort can occur in any number of says. And so that's where as an engineer, I have to take the one data point I have and then understand how that could possibly change. And then I could analytically put in different size people and then carry it forward to that assessment of potential injury.  Host: Yeah, it seems, I think the way I'm kind of describing it and they way you're describing it, it does seem pretty straightforward, but I think there's more to it. But so before we kind of go into the Orion part, let's just kind of expand on this biomechanics part. You know where did this all start? Tell us the history about biomechanics and why this is important.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so it really is a relatively a recent field of engineering, in that let's say by the 1950s we started seeing automotive accidents in which people were not surviving. Right? We had vehicles that went fast enough now to impart a load, potentially beyond what the body could handle. At that time, very little research had been done. There were limited animal studies trying to characterize impact. But the one person that would probably be credited as the grandfather of impact biomechanics would be a guy named Colonel John Paul Stapp. He was actually a physician within the Air Force. This was in the 1950s. And if you Google him, you can look up on YouTube John Paul Stapp 46.2 Gs and what that means is envision this, in the '50s your boss comes into a Monday morning meeting and he says, all right team, here's what we're going to do. We're going to strap me to a rocket sled. And I'm going to go down a track at 630 miles an hour, and then you're going to stop me within 1 second. [laughter] Everybody in? Would blow your mind, right? You'd think this is insane.   Host: Yeah.  Mark Baldwin: But the reality is, at that time, remember this is the '50s, they didn't understand what a human body could take. Now, he didn't just jump into that. He actually did a number of impact tests where he strapped himself into a seat and then he just slammed the seat and arrested it quickly. And he flails forward, but he's okay. Well, they worked themselves up to this rocket sled test. And you can see the video on YouTube, but what he did was he said, all right. I'm going to put myself in this situation because I want that datapoint. This could end badly, but we need to understand. And as part of the Air Force, he was really thinking of the entire air crew. Before we expose and ask our pilots to be exposed to ejections and crashes, I'm going to understand this. So, he strapped himself in, put a helmet on and he went shooting down this track at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. At the time, he was considered the fastest man alive at 632 miles an hour. He stopped like I said within 1 second. That imparted 46.2 Gs. So, that's 46 times his own body weight. Nearly 8000 pounds when he stopped. And when he stopped, he had broken ribs. He had a hernia. He shattered his wrist, his eyes hemorrhaged. He was temporarily blinded. His eyes were full of blood, and he fractured his tailbone. However, he survived. And that datapoint to this day is one of the most extreme exposures, intentional extreme exposures that survived. And that later populated a limit for what we consider people can take from just an acceleration exposure standpoint. Now, keep in mind he was well protected. He had a huge harness on and a helmet, etcetera. But he put himself at risk to make that point.  Host: Yeah, the idea is you know how much can the human body withstand. And this guy put himself through the most extreme circumstances possible to like you said, get that datapoint. But now what can we learn from that? I think you know one of the first things I think of is, all right, well if we're going to design a system, let's make it so that it doesn't exert 42Gs on a human body, right? I think that's probably fair.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. So, then I guess a lot of that got taken into human spaceflight then. Because if you're talking about, you know we kind of referenced an abort scenario, but even launches and stuff like that, you just, you don't want to have that much force on a person.  Mark Baldwin: That's right, but keep in mind and this is one thing that's probably not clear is there is a certain amount of impact that you can take without damage. And then there's certain levels of damage within the body, and certain types of damage within the body that can occur. And the interesting part is now it depend on which direction you load and by how much. A lot of people ask me this question. When we have an abort, let's take this ascent abort case. Everybody asks well me, well are they going to pass out. Well, the answer is not necessarily. It's very much a function of how intense that acceleration is, or the magnitude of the acceleration, and then how quick it occurs. And that's one thing that after Stapp was done with his research, a guy name Jim Brinkley who was a civilian working at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, he during the Vietnam era wanted to address a little bit more dedicated to directionality and that magnitude what the limits were. So, he took Air Force cadets, put them into his own sled test. They didn't go anywhere close to 46 Gs, but what he did was he placed them at different orientations. So, head up, head down. Frontward, backward and started to vary the magnitude and the duration of those pulses and by doing that, he was able to start to fill in the blanks of what could the human body take if you were well supported, if you had a full harness, if you had a helmet. And so, from that we developed what's called the Brinkley Model named after Mr. Brinkley. And that gave us, we'll call it a first cut, or the first level of understanding of when I go to look at any and all of Orion mission throughout the mission, any high G level events, I can use this Brinkley Model to characterize that acceleration in any direction, in any seat, and get a sense of whether I'm going to induce injury. I don't know what the injury is going to be. I just know that maybe an injury could occur and how severe that injury might be.  Host: Yeah, so ever just before spaceflight, Brinkley was looking at this, I guess short duration acceleration sort of phenomenon. And I think you know we were in the middle of like you said the Vietnam War coming up in the '60s here. You know, I'm guessing like a lot of, there were already systems of jets and other kind of spacecraft where they exposed to these high Gs. You know what were those systems doing to these soldiers. Did they not really realize until after Stapp and Brinkley was investigating this, like oh, this is probably you know the way that we're looking at humans and the mechanical side of things should probably be in sync.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so that's where the story gets a little more interesting in fact. Because what they found were Air Force pilots would rather crash their planes into the ground than eject. And you can say, well why is that? And it's because the spinal injury rate was unacceptably high. So, the pilot basically made a calculation that I would rather crash and take my chances than eject. Well, clearly that's a terrible design, but to be fair, what they didn't realize is these accelerations are one portion of the picture. There is another aspect which is what's the direction of loading relative to sensitive parts of the body. So, now instead of looking at just acceleration, now let’s start to hone in on parts that could be injured, such as the cervical spine at the base of the skull. Does the helmet contribute that, adding mass to the head contribute to that And so, they started to dig in a little bit deeper? And that's what is really more the secondary level that we use today. So we still use Brinkley, as that first pass at acceleration assessment. But once we do that, we need to now look at Orion specific hardware and that means the seat, the suit, the harness. How do all those pieces fit together and will any of those contribute to now a localized injury, let's say at the head or neck.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, so I guess before we really dive into all of these different components. The seat, the suit, the helmet, and all that, for specifically Orion, you know let's talk about you know where these injuries can come from. You know, what are we looking at if you had to break it down of the main sources?  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so in 2013, NASA solicited a variety of experts in the field. So, academics, we brought in the Air Force, we brought in the Navy. And we posed the same question. What do we need to really be looking at for human space flight? And really this was rewriting the book for any and all man-rated capsules or vehicles. And so, at that time, there was already a quite established body of work done in the automotive industry, and Air Force to assess localized injury. So, we got to the deeper layer of what could be injured and how. So, in your car that you drove to work today, every part of that car has to conform to a certain set of automotive standards. And those, when you run a crash test will assess the likelihood of skull fracture by hitting your head on any part of the vehicle. A neck or cervical fracture that could in part forces in moments right below the skull. There's chest, there's pelvis, there's any parts of the body that would be sensitive to either localized or acceleration loading now become adopted as part of the standard. Because we needed to understand these things, especially because spacecrafts are not cars. Now, we're putting, and if you look at the interior of the Soyuz, you can see how astronauts are placed in more of a fetal posture, plus they're reclined back relative to the ground. Very different than what you would see in your typical vehicle—or automotive vehicle. So, now we have to take into account the specific configuration for any and all spacecraft. And how the helmet interacts with the seat, the harness, and as you land, whatever your environments are; whether it's hitting the water after a splash down, or during an abort, now you have to start looking at each of these pieces of information in those environments against what are established limits.  Host: Yeah, okay. So, let's see if you're looking at all of these different elements of how, you know all of the different sources or I guess you can say locations of the injury, you know what can really cause this injury especially when it comes to space flight. You know I'm thinking abasically abort is a good scenarios, but even like major traumatic things. Like can a launch be one of the sources, or you know, acceleration, vibration, what are we looking at?  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so it really does fall into three different categories. The first would be vibration. And vibration is not very intuitive to most people because you don't experience it in everyday life. And yet, the shear nature of vibration, I mean it goes up and down. Your loading will switch direction. The magnitude and the duration of that just like impact matters quite a bit and then whether it's applied head to tail, or chest to back, those kinds of things also make a difference. So, we have to look at vibration from as soon as they light the rocket, all the way through ascent. And then of course, during abort, the abort motor will have a much different vibration profile than your typical ascent. So, that's—number 1 is vibration. Number 2 is sustained acceleration and we consider that anything that occurs and lasts for longer than half a second. So, that would be like your centrifuge testing and G lock, when you're pulling Gs in an airplane. We have certain limits that were characterized back in the Apollo days to understand okay, when does somebody pass out? And then, third is the short duration acceleration, really impact and that's the Brinkley Model. And for the localized injuries we can get into crash test dummies and what those do and that's really our key to be able to understand and characterize when a localized injury might occur.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, let's go through those three types of injuries that I guess you said starting with vibration. I mean I'm trying to imagine myself, maybe on like a ride, some kind of rollercoaster ride where I'm vibrating intensely. I can't imagine being vibrating so intensely that it has bodily harm, but I'm sure there are scenarios. You know, what is so bad about vibration, why is this a concern for us?  Mark Baldwin: Well, so first of all, going back to what I started with, the mechanical system, the body as a mechanical system, you can imagine that all these tissues from rigid bones to soft tissues like the heart, they all have unique mechanical properties. And in terms of vibration, we refer to a resident frequency. And that means something that at a certain frequency, will start to resonate, will start to move anh amplify an input. So, the body is sensitive to different frequencies. And so, to understand that fully, and understand that within the spacecraft environment, there's really no substitute for human subject testing. And so, back in the '60s the same test lab that did the impact testing of the air cadets also strapped them to vibration tables. So, if you go on YouTube, bioastronautics research government archives, you can see some of these tests. And these guys were heroic. Because they were trying to establish the limit of what somebody could take under vibration. And it wasn't just random vibration, where that frequency changes. So, you'd be moving in and out of sensitive frequency. These were sign sweeps which means you are going up and down at a specific frequency. And if you go to the video, you see these guys, it looks like they're just trying to hop up and down off the table. They had them laying on their back. And the way they conducted these studies was really interesting. I sure wouldn't want to do it now, but they basically put them at a certain frequency, and then they started turning up the volume, if you will. The gain on these frequencies. So, these people went from just giggling a little bit to really bouncing and getting airborne with only that belt holding them on to the seat. And they basically kept these guys going until they hit the switch and said stop. So, it was really intense. But they captured that data, and that data today is what we use, the limit of do not exceed on Orion.  Host: So, yeah, well I mean first of all, yes, I think brave is a good word that you used to describe these guys. Because I certainly wouldn't sign up for that test. Hey, shake me as violently as you can. Let's test the limits of the human body. But you know what did we learn? What can the human body withstand? What happens when we get to those higher levels, and those higher gains of vibration, what's going on?  Mark Baldwin: So, yeah what happens at that, the more extreme levels is you start to lose the ability to take a breath. Like your lungs are being compressed and expanded too fast and you can't breathe. Other things they found were pain in the head, headache. So, it's almost like you're shaking your brain inside your skull to the point where it really starts to hurt. Of course we don't want to go anywhere close to that level at this point. And certainly for not the durations. So, building upon the approach that they took back in the '60s we wanted to answer that same question specific to Orion. So, in 2016 I was working with colleagues at Johnson Space Center in the human engineering group and we developed a plan. We said, you know we're not going to go to the extreme levels, but we do want to characterize what it's like for our astronauts to ride Orion. So, I suggested, well, let's put together a plan, let's get a real seat, let's get a flight like suit, and oh by the way, I'll go first. You can strap me into the seat. And they said sure, Mark, you're a perfect dummy. [Laughter] So, they brought me down to JSC, we had it all set up. We did those same sign sweeps, but we didn't go nearly the same amplitude as the guys in the '60s did, because quite honestly, we didn't need to establish that limit anymore. I didn't want to be shaken to the point where I couldn't breathe.  Host: Yeah, you already had the data.  Mark Baldwin: Right, but we actually were interested in collecting data to build a model. So, interestingly, I'm going to live on as a stick figure model in our vibracoustic analyses. Because we used the data collected on me to make a little stick figure version of me and put it in our analytical really big, complicated model. But what was great about that test was, kind of like you, Gary, I didn't really have a great understanding of what does vibration feel like, you know what hurts, or what is really so intense that I can't handle it? And so, by going first, I said let's get me in there, let's run different tests. Let's see what this feels like. And as an engineer, went back to the, I really want to understand how is this going to affect the crew? So, they strapped me in the seat for two days in a row. I spent 7 hours in a seat. We went through a variety of different tests. We did sign sweeps, but we also simulated both lift off and the most extreme parts of the ascent, which it's called buffet, but that's when the vehicle is starting to shake across a variety of different frequencies. And then going back to the sensitive part of the human body, we wanted to make sure that nothing was going to be damaged, or I didn't feel head pain or anything like that. And as a fun aside, the thing I was most worried about was we had high speed video focused on my face and as we were doing these tests, visors down. And I was really nervous about throwing up inside the helmet, because that would have been caught on video. I never would have lived that one down. But turns out I didn't throw up.  [Laughter]  Host: Well, okay so it looks like the sources for vibration for Orion are liftoff and this buffet, like this time during ascent. There are the primary sources of the most violent vibration. So, tell me, you experienced it. What was it like? What did it really feel like?  Mark Baldwin: So, for the most part, when the crew are going to be on, in our case it will be the space launch system. You know, they're going to be 300 feet up above where the flames are coming out of the bottom of the rocket. You would think that's far up, but you have to almost look at a rocket and a capsule as just a stack of springs, right? You're sitting on metal that is all capturing a lot of this structure born vibration. Way down below you, but it's transmitting all the way up into the seat. By the time it gets to the crew, you know, ascent as you go, is what we call random vibration, as in you're moving in and out of certain frequencies and amplitudes, so the severity is changing constantly. And really actually, the test series was to focus on legibility. Could we read the display units? And interestingly, so I had this display unit suspended over my head as I was being shaken to what we considered an ascent and even that buffet, that most severe part. And I could read the displays just fine. And at times the displays would blur ever so slightly and then snap right back into focus. And that's an illustration of the effect that it's having. Because it's random, sometimes you'll tune into the eyeball or the head. But it will move in and out quickly. So, it really was not, it was not uncomfortable at all. It was kind of neat, honestly to hear as well as feel that input to the crew. And we came out of that series with a lot of confidence that you know, not only will our crew be able to read the display units, but they're going to be quite fine.  Host: That's good and that's actually an important reason to conduct the test in the first place, rather than just sort of assume or predict what's going to happen, put yourself in the scenario, test it out and see oh by the way, whenever you're launching you're going to feel the vibration, but you know you'll be able to read the screen. It might come in and out every once in a while, but it's going to work out for you.    Mark Baldwin: Yep. That’s right.  Host: Yeah. All right. So, that's vibration, which it's super interesting, and that's just only one phase of the flight, though. The biggest sources there are liftoff and ascent, but what about the sustained acceleration. Where's that coming from?  Mark Baldwin: Yeah. So, sustained—we'll talk about the ascent abort trajectories for AA2, but the way that works is the vehicle is going to be pulled away from the rocket. So, the Orion crew module will be separated, and while the accelerations are severe right in the beginning, you're still not quite done. You still have to do a reorientation to put the bottom of the vehicle, the heat shield side first, because that's what hits the water. Then you have to go through a series of parachutes deployments and each one of those releases a packed parachute on the vehicle. It inflates and then the crew module is just dangling and spinning underneath. We'd like to control that to a level where you know you're not going to pass anybody out. But sometimes parachutes fail. In the case of a pad aboard, you have very little time to get all of the parachutes out. So sometimes you have to skip a few and go right to the main parachutes to open all those up before you hit the ground. So, we work with the guided navigation control folks, at both Lockheed Martin and NASA to assess how much acceleration you would feel in the seat, and then along which direction, and we have these charts and we can look at each one of these types of environments throughout the entire re-entry and all the chute sequences and confirm that yeah, you might be spun for a little bit but you're not going to pass out.  Host: Yeah. Yeah. And we will get into the ascent abort and exactly what's happening there, but it sounds like that's going to be the source for this sustained acceleration that's longer than half of a second.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. But then the short duration one, I think this can come from several different sources, right? The impact sort of Brinkley Model sort of thing, where are these coming from?  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so if you go through the mission sequence, the first possibility you could see this would be an abort. Like I mentioned, you could have an abort on the pad. Now, the abort motors were designed to get you away quickly and safely. But like we mentioned earlier you can't do it so fast that you liquify the crew in the process, right? So, there's a limit to the G levels that you want to keep during that abort. And now, on the pad, you can imagine you're not moving, versus you're going really fast during ascent you have to do the ascent abort. It has to operate in both ways and it also can't overload the crew, both during ascent and pad. So, that's one major thing to look at. Pretend, we get all the way around, we do our mission, we're coming back through. Now we have a shoot deploy sequences. Those can impart a jerk onto the vehicle. And the weird thing there, the vehicle may be oriented in different ways, right? You actually come in on Orion upside down and backwards. And through a series of maneuvers then you get feet first and down. When those shoots deploy, though, you may be still spinning as the next step deploys. So, we have to look at directional acceleration there. But the magnitude is generally a lot lower. The last thing is landing. And so, in my job I really focus on about 2 seconds of an entire mission, an entire two week mission, I spend all my time looking at abort and landing. Because that's when the accelerations are the most severe. And landing is really interesting because it is unique to space flight, because the—our capsule and others are going to land in the ocean. If we have an abort, we're not done yet you've still got to land in the Atlantic. If you have a nominal re-entry in the Pacific, we have to land, and we could land under a variety of conditions. There's winds, and waves, and then you know anybody that's done a belly flop off a diving board, you know that if you land flat, that hurts a lot, right? So, we don't want to land too flat. And we also don't want to land too steep, such that we roll over. So, we spend quite a bit of time and have done a series of really interesting tests to characterize, not only how does the vehicle respond to landing, but how do the crew respond to that acceleration in each of the seats.  Host: Yeah, you know that's funny that you describe that in the entire duration of the space flight, you're really focused on a few seconds, but these are a very important few seconds.  Mark Baldwin: They are.  Host: Yeah, yeah. So, tell me what are you doing to test this I guess we'll focus on landing for now, landing in the water. How do you actually get a feel for what that's going to be like?  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so this is where the collaboration between Lockheed Martin and NASA really worked well. So, let's back up a little bit. Several years ago, we didn't really have a great sense of how Orion, when it hit the water would translate to local seat acceleration, so we could do those Brinkley and the crash test dummy assessments. So, instead we started out with faking it, where we put a seat on a sled and we went to that same location, Wright Pat Air Force Base that put humans in the seats and we simulated what we thought was an acceleration profile based on some preliminary drop tests with a very crude version of the vehicle, a boiler plate. And we had run tests with a full scale boiler plate at NASA Langley. They built a dedicated pool, a 20-foot pool under what they called the Gantry, which was used back in the Apollo days. And the Gantry is really neat, it's this 200 foot tall structure that they can pick up a 20,000 pound vehicle, raise it up to 100 feet, swing it and then drop it into the water and let it smack. And we can do that under controlled conditions. We can either turn it around, or we can tip it forward, or we can make it flat for that belly flop. So, we spent quite a bit of time, and we thought through this. We said all right let's first start with the simple boiler plate, doesn't have to be a fancy vehicle. Let's just drop something in the water and characterize those accelerations. So, we did that. Then we took those accelerations and we translated that over to the sled tests at Wright Pat Air Force Base. Then we started testing dummies inside, crash test dummies, inside of suits in our seat. And started running those tests. So, we're starting to build this understanding of how does the whole vehicle acceleration during landing relate to the localized injury potential at the crew. So, as we did a couple of those preliminary series we said, well why don't we just put the whole thing together and do this for real. So, in 2016, again with the NASA Langley Team and the Lockheed Martin Landing Team, we developed a plan of 10 different tests. Now, this time the tests had a lot more fidelity to them in that we used and recycled what we called the ground test article which was of medium fidelity. It had an interior much like the structure of the real vehicles. But it allowed us to put in real seats and what we call the crew impact attenuation system and I'll get to that in a second. It allowed us to put in a small and a large crash test dummy inside a spacesuit and then drop that whole thing in the water multiple times. And so, there's actually a picture of myself and Ricky Barr from the Orion Crew Survivability Systems at NASA JSC. We were in the vehicle, stuffing the dummies into the suits. And that picture made it into \"National Geographic\" in November 2016.  Host: Oh, that's cool. So, yeah, essentially to summarize, you're basically throwing this module, basically what is to be the Orion in the water, seeing what the crew is going to be really up for when it comes to a landing and all these different scenarios. And then putting, you know, this test dummy, this article that's seeing where the loads are going to be put, right? So, you know of throw him in different directions, put him in a suit, basically, replicate the scenario of what the crew is going to be and then see, is this where the design element comes in where you're like okay, we need to put the seat this way, we need to make sure the suit has this sort of material, or is situated it this way for the comfort of the crew. You know, what are some of the ways you're designing for successful Orion mission come in?  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so that's where all of this goes way beyond me. Right? Some of the teams that I mentioned before, the guys developing the seat, the Lockheed Martin Crew Systems Team, the Orion Crew Survivability Systems, that's the suit guys. So, Rick and I flew to Langley to make sure we set all that stuff up inside the vehicle, as close to flight as we could get it. Then, another interesting thing that folks may not know about, the impact attenuation system. So, on Apollo, all three people were strapped to a single couch. That couch was suspended inside the vehicle via these struts. And those struts were meant to stroke the couch if you hit hard enough. Well, on Orion we actually started out with a similar design, we got 4 crew on Orion, but the struts were kind of bulky and in the way, we didn't want those. So, we said, well wait, can't we do this better? So, we took a page from another industry, the helicopter industry. So, Blackhawk Helicopters, the pilots that sit in those front seats, they actually, when they hit the ground, because the impact is so severe, the seats are designed to physically translate down a series of rails and you can end up through the floor, by design, through the floor in a Blackhawk and the floor is cut out. What that does is it reduces the severity of the acceleration especially on the spine, right? That's the most sensitive part of the body that you want to protect. So, helicopters have been crashing for years and years, they've evolved this technology and we say, well why don't we borrow some of that technology and put it into Orion. So, we did and not only that, but instead of everybody being tied together, which wouldn't give the same acceleration to a small lightweight crew member as a big crew member, we said why don't we de-couple each of the seats, why don't we develop an impact attenuation system along the spine that can be tuned per the person's mass. And then everybody sees a comparable acceleration. Doesn't matter if you're minimum 94-pound, or you're maximum 243-pound crew member, everybody will see the same acceleration if you have a hard enough landing to stroke that. So, what we did is we put those units inside this test series to see if it would work. And lo and behold when we hit just right, and we loaded up the spine, we saw our system do exactly what we wanted it to do, which was stroke along the spine and limit that acceleration and that load to the cervical and the lumbar spine.  Host: That is awesome. So, this goes back to your basic description of what biomechanical engineering really is all about, is this flexibility when it comes to the crew members. And this system, correct me if I'm wrong, basically what you're doing is you're making each seat, knowing who's going to sit in that seat, you're making it so that a crew member of this mass, you kind of tweak it up a little bit and it is specifically designed to I guess decrease the acceleration in the event of an impact for that specific crew member.  Mark Baldwin: Yep. That's right. That's right. And while we were making this change, I'll illustrate one of the most interesting days I had on the program, I get a phone call and it's a guy name Milt Heflin who basically had my job 50 years ago. He was an Apollo engineer that was the landing engineer and the impact attenuation system engineer. And this guy totally nice guy, he was great. But he was kind of grilling me a little bit, like do you know what you're doing buddy. In a really nice way, but at the same time, I took him through everything I just described and said, you know what, we felt like there's new technology we're going to leverage it, we should put it in. And I got the thumbs up from him, and so basically, I was like success. You know I passed the test.  Host: Well, that's the idea, right? The idea is yes there's a lot of great lessons we can learn from the past because other people have done great research as well, but let's take this already great technology with like you said the helicopter technology which has been crashed over and over a lot of good data there. And you can basically take that into human spaceflight and make an even better system that's going to make it safer for the crew. And that's the ultimate goal is the safety of the crew.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, yeah. And let me take that one level deeper. So, we have a dedicated group of about a half a dozen people within occupant protection. And we started this group with a large group but then we kind of refined it down to a subset of members. And some of those members have been really instrumental in helping us. So, the suit guys at JSC, Dustin Gommer, and Ricky Bauer and Jeff Suey, they're helping us understand all the features of the suit. Because when we go back to this acceleration environment, and now we put a heavy helmet and a bulky helmet on a body that is landing and hitting the water, we've got to make sure that that helmet does not now impart a load on the neck to overload the sensitive portion, which is the cervical spine. I think folks remember the Dale Earnhardt NASCAR death. That was a basilar skull fracture because the added weight of his helmet twerked his neck right at that sensitive location and overloaded it. That's where that stress exceeded the strength. We're trying to prevent that. In addition, we've recruited folks like Dr. Nancy Curry who was an astronaut at JSC, and she is 5' 2, a total bad ass. She is the most awesome person you would ever meet. [Laughter] But she has been really helpful to make sure we keep in mind as we're doing these assessments, as we're testing, as we're doing analysis that we don't forget that you have to make sure this system works for the shorter stature crew members, and the tall, and the small, the lighter weight and the heavier. So, we spent a lot of time focusing on not just running a single test. And this is where the tools of today actually are beyond what the guys could do in Apollo. We can run analyses. So, myself and other analysts, Jeff Summers, Chuck Lawrence, Jacob Putnam, and Martin Annette we run what's called LS-DYNA, it's nonlinear analysis. And we replicate as close as possible, either those sled tests or the full scale water drop test with the small, and the large, and the medium size crash test dummies. And from those dummies, you can think of it as a bit of a transfer function. You put an acceleration in and then outcomes from the models now, forces and moments at the sensitive areas. Whether it's the neck, or accelerations at the head. And that gives us answers that will tell us, did we induce a neck injury. Do we have a skull fracture? Do we have traumatic brain injury? We can now look at all of that stuff and not just for the test that we ran, but now we can run all sorts of different environments, that could occur, that we can't go run 10,000 tests, but we can run 10,000 models and collect all those answers and then get a pretty holistic picture of what the risk is for any size crew and in any situation.  Host: Yeah. And this kind of goes back to that biomechanical engineering, that flexibility. But also kind of highlights, you know why testing is important and why testing over and over again is important. Because the truth is that people come in different shapes and sizes.   Mark Baldwin: Yes.  Host: So, you need to accommodate that. And it makes engineering I'm sure for you a little bit more difficult, but it is worth it because really the idea is to protect as many astronauts as possible. And I'm sure that this could be translated to other places too. You know, you're getting really good data you can share that.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, and as we go forward, so that's let's go back to Ascent-Abort-2 test if now's the time.   Host: Yeah, go ahead.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so we, as a program we need to understand these external environments as much as possible. But you can imagine an ascent-abort test is not cheap. And we can't do a lot of them. So, we have to use this combination of tests and analysis of that test. And then analysis of things we couldn't test to try to fill in the blanks. So, Ascent-Abort 2 similar to the very first water impact test, we have a crew module on there that's fairly simple. It doesn't have seats; it doesn't have crash test dummies or anything in it. But we do have a bunch of instrumentation in and around the crew module and the launch abort system. We're going to take that vehicle up to 31,000 feet. We're going to initiate the abort. And the whole thing is going to be over in 1 minute. But the sequence we go through is going to help us ground our structural model. So, this is more classical mechanical engineering, where we'll understand the vibration, we'll understand the stress. We'll understand all those forcing functions. The things external to the vehicle, and we'll ground our models. Then, analytically, I can take what we just learned. And now I can drop in any size crash test dummy, or any size stick figure mode, remember based on my under vibration, and we can scale that to be large and small. And then assess, okay what would it have been like had we put somebody in that Ascent-Abort 2 test.  Host: Yeah, there you go. Ascent-Abort 2 you're not going to put the crash test dummies on there, but you're getting good info on what the environment is like, that's the idea right? So, you can do your own tests. Here's the data, not go do your own tests.  Mark Baldwin: Absolutely. And that's where the analyses and the computational power we have today makes that approach much more sensible, as opposed to Apollo, the only choice they had was to throw the vehicle in the water as many times as they could and record all the data. We can do all of that, I can run a million different landing cases in less than a week.  Host: Nice. Yeah, that's really, really important, you know efficiency, obviously. But so you've got this Ascent-Abort 2, you're going to get some great data from what it's like to abort in the event that the vehicle is already on its way to space and then is aborted. You got this, you got water impact testing. You got the sled test. You know what else do you need to test, or really is this going to give you a nice package to present to, you know the Orion folks or whoever to say, we're ready to fly.  Mark Baldwin: Yeah, so it's the last I think major extreme system level test that we're going to do, we're not quite done though, right, so the next big whole mission test is called Exploration Mission 1, EM1. That is going to be a lunar flyby. We're collecting data on that. In fact we have a seat and a mannequin and a suit that going's to ride in EM1. But we've opened the aperture beyond just occupant protection for that test series. Right? Of course we're going to get structural data. Of course we're going to go through the paces of the mission profile. But inside the cabin we're also going to add radiation torsos that are provided by the German Space Agency. So, we're actually collaborating on EM1 to try to make sure we address not just injury but radiation exposure. So, it's kind of cool, we've got two radiation torsos that are going to go in the bottom two seat locations. One of them is going to have a vest provided by the Israeli Space Agency to protect one of the German Space Agency torsos and the other one won't have a vest. So, we're going to kind of get a with-and-without comparison of the exposure as they do the lunar flyby. And that's all baked into EM1.  Host: Yeah, this is what I love about human spaceflight is all the international collaboration that comes with it. It's pretty cool to see all these people come together and do great things especially on EM1, which is going to be awesome. And especially for you because this is the last really big you know piece of data that you need for this occupant protection thing before you get to that, you know we're ready to fly thing, which I believe is EM—Exploration Mission 2, if I'm right.  Mark Baldwin: We are, yeah, we do have two more checkpoints. We've got more sled tests we're going to run; we'll call it the final Orion spacesuit. The final Orion seat. We're going to go back to the same location. Now that we've completed these full scale water drop tests and abort tests, now we've got that acceleration profile from those tests. And now when we run a sled test, we can come really close to reproducing what that environment looks like in the seat. But we can spend a lot of time and get high speed video and a lot of measurements now on our crash test dummies now put inside what we'll call the final flight suit seat design. So, that's still upcoming.  Host: A lot of great stuff coming up. Wow, Mark, this was very fascinating to hear all the different elements that go into really just a few key moments of human space flight, but extremely critical. And I think this was a fantastic overview. So, Mark I really appreciate your time to bring us through this biomechanics and this spaceship crash testing today.  Mark Baldwin: Sure, thanks for having me.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Mark Baldwin about occupant protection and crash testing and biomechanics; I hope you really enjoyed it.  If you are not done with everything we have to talk about about Orion, we have plenty of other episodes.  You can check out Episode 66, called “5,000F,” that one was on Orion’s heat shields; you can go to Episode 69, which was “Navigating Deep Space,” on navigation and communication; Episode 75, that had, talked about radiation shielding; Episode 79, on, it’s called “Livable Space,” it was on life support, and, life support systems and environmental control; Episode 84 we talked about propulsion, and there’s plenty more to come.  Actually, if you go deeper, back, on Episode 62 we dive into AA-2, the mission we talked about during today’s podcast, the ascent abort mission; Episode 28 we talk about living in Orion for three weeks; and Episode 17 is just general Orion.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 287, “Science in a Spacesuit.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight and more. If you're an active listener of this podcast, hopefully you're familiar with spacewalking; but if not, in short, this is where astronauts put on those puffy, white spacesuits so they can work on the outside of a spacecraft. Most recently, we see these a lot aboard the International Space Station for maintenance and upgrade tasks like swapping out batteries and installing new solar arrays. But not very often do astronauts go outside in a spacesuit to conduct science, and that activity is coming up soon. Scientists have been preparing for an extravehicular science activity called the International Space Station External Microorganism study. During a spacewalk with other maintenance and upgrade tasks, spacewalkers will dedicate some time to conducting a scientific activity to understand more about the microbial environment on the outside of the International Space Station that could help us to better understand likely contaminants for when we're exploring the Moon and other planets. This study has been a long time in the making and is about to launch to the International Space Station on Northrop Grumman's CRS-19 cargo mission. We're lucky enough to bring in the project lead, Dr. Aaron Regberg, who's also a geomicrobiologist and a planetary protection lead. He's coming on the podcast to help us describe what this experiment is all about. So let's get right into it. Enjoy.    [Music]  Host: Aaron Regberg, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.    Aaron Regberg: Thanks. I'm excited to be here.    Host: All right. Well, we're going to be talking about this project that you've been working on for quite some time. But I know you have a very interesting, I want to stop, start with your job title, actually, because it's so interesting when, when you, when you sent the email and we were going back and forth talking about this, it said, it said Dr. Aaron Regberg, geomicrobiologist and planetary protection lead. So what, what's, what exactly does that mean? What, what's your role here at Johnson [Space Center]?    Aaron Regberg: So, I, I kind of have a couple different hats that I wear here. My, my primary job is as a astromaterials curator, so that's one of the scientists that helps to take care of all of the extraterrestrial samples that we've collected. And I am the one that tries to keep the clean rooms microbially clean, and worries about, you know, terrestrial microbes altering our samples. And then in addition to that, I am sort of the planetary protection point of contact for the space center. And planetary protection is like this kind of weird discipline that sits at the edge of science and engineering, kind of at the boundary of the two, and our job is to make sure that we don't inadvertently contaminate other planets -- so take Earth bacteria to Mars, for example, and, and then when we're trying to look for life on Mars all we find is the bacteria that we brought with us.  But it's also about making sure that we don't accidentally bring anything scary or dangerous back from other planets. So, you know, back in Apollo times, for the first couple of Apollo missions, they were really worried about, you know, dangerous microbes from the Moon and everything was quarantined: the astronauts, the samples.  That was sort of proto-planetary protection on the, on the backwards side.    Host: OK. All right. So you're not like commander-in-chief for alien invasions.    Aaron Regberg: Absolutely not. No. [Laughter]  Host: OK. All right. It sounds like a cool title.   Aaron Regberg: And even, and even if I was, there's, there's somebody at [NASA] Headquarters who is the planetary protection officer…  Host: Thinking about exactly that, yeah.  Aaron Regberg: …and they're, they're in charge. Yeah.    Host: [Laughter] OK. All right. Well, still that's, that, that's a good description for exactly what we're going to be talking about today, which is this, this, this project that's happening on the International Space Station. But it's, it, just on this background, this geomicrobiologist and, and you have that day-to-day job of just making sure the, the, the, the materials that we have in our curation facility are protected as well, and you're, you're thinking about the contamination for our planet and for others. I wonder what got you to where you are? How'd you, how'd you kind of go down the path to get you where you are today?    Aaron Regberg: Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a good question and one I get a lot, and I don't think I have a particularly, like, standard or normal career path.   Host: I don't think any of us do. [laughter]  Aaron Regberg: Oh, yeah. So I studied geology in, in college, and then when I went to get my Ph.D. I was really interested in how the microbiological world affects geology. And so I studied for my Ph.D. bacteria that dissolve rocks and the way that they dissolve rocks, they're actually metabolically, they're, they're breathing them, so they don't breathe oxygen, they, they sort of breath iron oxides, and, and reduce those iron oxides and make them soluble. All of that work ended up leading me to a job in industry for a while, actually. So I was doing research for an oil company, studying bacteria that lived in oil reservoirs and how they were altering the physical properties of the rocks underground and the chemical properties of the oil, and then trying to use all of that information to see if we could look for more oil, because that's primarily what oil companies are interested in.    Host: Sure.  Aaron Regberg: And after, after being there for about five years, I kind of realized it wasn't, wasn't a great fit for me culturally. And I just, happened that this position that I have now in the curation office at NASA was being advertised right as I was kind of looking around and, and thinking about wanting to do something else. And I was, I was qualified for it in part because of the, the work and the things that I had learned at the oil company.   Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: So I, I know people want to ask that question and have like a path that they can replicate, but the advice that I always try to give people is just follow things that look interesting to you, because you'll, it's hard to predict where, where it's going to end up.    Host: That's, yeah, that's really good advice because look where you are now, and now you get to work on this fantastic project, and that's sort of what I want to get into. So it's extra, or external microorganisms on the International Space Station. So, at first glance, right, it kind of sounds like there's these creepy crawlies around the outside of the space station, but I know it's more complicated than that. Just, what in general is this study and what, what are we exactly looking for as part of this?    Aaron Regberg: So, so we're looking for evidence that, that microbes, bacteria, and fungi from the inside of space station are leaking out of space station and surviving in a way where either, either because they're dormant or because they're actually growing, which is less likely, but surviving in a way that we can detect them by, by going out and sampling the outside of space station. And the reason we're trying to do this is, is directly tied into the planetary protection stuff that we were talking about a minute ago. The systems that are used on the International Space Station and for our spacesuits today are likely very similar to the systems that we want to use to, to get people to Mars and to land on Mars and to have habitats on Mars. All of the, all of the vents and ports on the outside of space station are unfiltered currently. So whatever is inside is just being shot out into space. And that's totally fine for low-Earth orbit. We're not worried about contaminating low-Earth orbit with stuff from Earth.   Host: Yeah.  Aaron Regberg: But it could be a problem for Mars: if we're going to send humans to Mars and we want them to look for signs of life and they're living in this habitat that is just, you know, venting gas and, and maybe leaking a little bit of water out onto the surface, we could be creating our own contaminated zone around the, around the habitat. So, you know, as a scientist I'm like, OK, well put some filters on those vents, like go off, do it, it'll be fine. Like, here's the size filter. But when you talk to engineers, they want to know, well, OK, well how, what's the threshold of leakage that's acceptable? What's, you know, how many microbes is too many and how many microbes are we leaking now? And we have no idea because we've never measured it. So the, the, like, really big picture idea for this experiment is just to kind of gather that sort of data so that we can go back to the engineers and say, OK, here are the specifications for the system we want you to design.    Host: Oh, wow. This, so this is, I mean, this experiment is huge. It's going to potentially inform the design for the vents and filters on Mars landers and stuff.  Aaron Regberg: We, we hope so. Yeah.   Host: Wow.  Aaron Regberg: That, that's the, the goal is to start gathering that data to close that knowledge gap.   Host: The idea of contamination, like what this, the, the concern in the first place: is it, is it more so that the microbes are being shot out and we could potentially like misidentify and just you could say, oh, there's life on Mars, but actually it's the stuff that we've been shooting out, or is it, does it sort of maybe ruin the science for, you know, what, describe what, what exactly contamination means?    Aaron Regberg: It's kind of both. I, I think it's, it, you know, one concern is that we could mistake terrestrial microbes for native Martian life, or wherever we're going. The other concern, and maybe this is more likely, is that the terrestrial microbes would grow and proliferate on the surface of Mars and would, would cover up any evidence of indigenous life. So it would be like, you know, introducing a, a non-native species somewhere on Earth, like the, the cane toads in Australia, and they just sort of proliferate and get out of control and then we can't find what we're looking for because all we're able to see is the, is the stuff that we brought with us.    Host: OK. All right. That makes sense. Now, in terms of this, this study, right, I think, I think you mentioned that, you know, you're trying to come up with, you know, the engineers are asking for specifications on how much you're leaking, but you mentioned we don't know. So is this study truly novel in that we have, we really haven't had a chance yet to go out and swab an external environment in, you know, an external space environment? We have, there's no, is there any history here that we can learn from? There is.   Aaron Regberg: There is.  Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: Yeah. So the, the, the Russian cosmonauts have actually gone out and tried to collect these samples from portions of the Russian segments of ISS. And they were really focused on trying to cultivate and grow any microorganisms that they collected, and they were able to do that. So that is some sort of preliminary evidence that there may actually be living organisms on the outside of station. There are some, you know, anytime you do an experiment there, you always look at it afterwards and you're like, oh, I could have done this better, or I could have improved that. And so there are some things like that with the Russian experiment. And so what we're trying to do is to replicate their experiment and do a couple of things a, a little bit differently to try to, to make the data more robust. We're also not focused on trying to grow anything. We're going to bring, we're going to freeze the samples and bring them back and just sequence any DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) we can find. Part of the reason for doing that is that we think that's more similar to the kind of measurements people might want to make on other planets. It's unlikely that we're going to fly a bunch of, you know, petri dishes and stuff all the way to Mars. It's a lot of mass and…  Host: I see.  Aaron Regberg: …for other reasons. So that's, that's kind of what we're doing.   Host: You mentioned the kit and I definitely want to understand, like, the experiment just as a whole, but just the beginnings of this, right? Whenever you were having these conversations about filters and stuff, when you started having the conversation with engineers to, well, where can we, what can we do to get the data we need to inform the engineers about filters, how did you eventually make your way from that conversation to, let's get in a spacesuit and swab the filters? So how did, how did that journey happen?    Aaron Regberg: A lot of that conversation I think actually started even before I got to NASA. This was sort of an idea that people had, on, on day one when I showed up, and they had already built a prototype kit and they were testing it on the ground and in analog environments. And it was primarily an engineering-led effort as I, as I understand it. And the engineers were having a little bit of trouble keeping things sterile. So they were getting some contamination in their controls. And so, I think what happened is they said, oh, there's this new guy that showed up and he's like half a microbiologist and half a geologist, and he's, maybe he has some ideas about things that we can do differently to try to cut down on the, on the contamination.  Host: So you got pulled in. That’s…  Aaron Regberg: So I got pulled in.   Host: I see.  Aaron Regberg: Yeah. And then, you know how things kind of go at NASA, people move on to other positions or get pulled into other projects, and sort of all of a sudden I found myself writing the, writing the proposal to try to get more funding to actually get it up onto ISS because the people who had pulled me in had been themselves pulled into, you know, other, other activities.   Host: Kind of worked out in your favor though, because you became the lead of that.    Aaron Regberg: I did. Yeah. It is, it's, it's, it's really exciting actually.    Host: Yeah. That's really cool. So you, you mentioned, I don't, I don't think we, we addressed when you came to NASA.    Aaron Regberg: So I started at NASA in 2017.  Host: 2017; OK, relatively recently.     Aaron Regberg: Relatively recently.    Host: So past couple years you guys have been working on something like this. OK. So you wrote the proposal, and, and now it's going to be flying. Just, OK, let's, let's get into exactly what it is. You are the guy they pulled in and said, hey, we are having some trouble with contamination; how did you solve that? How did you solve the techniques to make sure you were minimizing contamination?    Aaron Regberg: A lot of it was just it, so the tool that they had was already well-suited, the prototype was already well-suited to sort of keep things clean and sterile. A lot of it was just sort of sterile technique or aseptic technique when, when thinking about cleaning it and putting it back together, and keeping, trying to minimize, you know, contamination from, from the people working with the tool. So we started cleaning it in the precision cleaning facilities at the, inside the astromaterials curation building, which are a little bit more specialized than I think the, the, the other ones on center. And so that helped, and then when we, we did all of the assembly after we cleaned and sterilized everything, we worked inside what's called a biosafety cabinet, but it's a, it looks kind of like a chemical fume hood, but it's specifically for trying to work as, as aseptically or sterilely as possible. So working inside that cabinet helped us to, to eliminate or minimize any concerns about contamination.   Host: When, when the astronauts would be doing it in the spacesuits, is the environment itself, just being in the vacuum of space, kind of working in your favor in terms of minimizing contamination?    Aaron Regberg: It might. But that's, yeah, that's a question that we kind, kind of open question that we have, but what we're going to have them do…  Host: It’s part of the experiment, yeah.  Aaron Regberg: …is, yeah, so in the kit we have, we have eight sort of swabs and we're going to have them use six of them to swab surfaces.  Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: And then we're going to have them take a seventh one and just open it up and kind of hold it out for 30 seconds or a minute and then put it back without touching anything.  Host: As like a control?  Aaron Regberg: As a control.   Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: Yeah. And then the eighth one will be another control or a blank where it never gets opened. So we, we did all the assembly, we put it together, and so if we find something in that sample, we know it's something that we accidentally introduced.    Host: OK. OK. So the kit that they're going to be bringing out with them, right, I think, is the idea here that they do this job as one of the many activities in a six-and-a half-hour EVA (extravehicular activity), right? It's not, it's not a dedicated swab EVA, right?   Aaron Regberg: No, no, no.   Host: Yeah.   Aaron Regberg: Absolutely not.   Host: Right.   Aaron Regberg: No. In, in fact, we're probably going to be what's called a, a get-ahead task.    Host: Oh, you don't even get on the timeline. Oh, man.   Aaron Regberg: Well, it's all in flux. The number…  Host: I see.  Aaron Regberg: …you know, at the, the way they schedule EVAs is, I'm learning a lot about it right now.    Host: Yeah. It's, it's tight. A lot of people want to do a lot of things.   Aaron Regberg: But it's, yeah, it's really tight. And so the, the latest, greatest plan that I'm aware of is it we’ll be sort of the last, the last task at the end of the EVA…  Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: …and it'll, where, where we get samples from and how many samples we get will in some part depend on, you know, how the rest of the EVA went and how much time they have at the end.   Host: Yeah. So what are the locations that were most interesting, the ones you identified, because you're not just be swabbing random areas on the outside, right?    Aaron Regberg: No, no. So we've identified some of these venting locations near the airlock. One of them is a, is a location that is used to vent carbon dioxide from inside station, so they have carbon dioxide removal systems that scrub CO2 out of the atmosphere to keep it safe and appropriate for the astronauts, and then that CO2 gets vented out into space.   Host: OK.   Aaron Regberg: So we think maybe there are microbes, you know, hitching a ride in that, in that gas stream. The other locations will be around the airlock. So the airlock, you can kind of think of it like a big vent, right?  Host: That makes sense.  Aaron Regberg: Every time you open the door, you get a, you know, they pull vacuum but you get a little puff of gas and whatever is on the astronaut suits is going out, out. And then the, the other location, the other vents, we're still kind of talking about. One idea is there are some vents that are releasing hydrogen. That, there's a, so there's a machine on the inside a station that produces oxygen from, by splitting water, so the hydrogen is a byproduct and that just gets vented…  Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: …out into space. And then there are some other, I guess, CO2 scrubbing systems that we might try to go sample. Again, some of it is going to depend on how much time the astronauts have, so we're sort of trying to, right now we're having this discussion, we're trying to generate like a priority list. Like, OK, if you have the full amount of time that we asked for, go do this and this and this and this, and if we only have 15 minutes maybe we'll just collect six samples right around the airlock…  Host: Right.  Aaron Regberg: …without going anywhere and we'll look at that data and then try to make a case for, for more time on a different EVA.  Host: Which would be convenient. The airlock would be convenient because they start and end the spacewalk there, right? But I guess what you're evaluating is, are these other places, could they potentially have more or less microbes? Or that is, are you evaluating that the microbial environment?    Aaron Regberg: That's right.   Host: I see.  Aaron Regberg: Yeah. And so, the, the vents actually have these little covers on them, I think to protect them from micrometeorite damage, and so we've gotten permission to be, for the astronauts to actually peel back that little cover and, and swab underneath. And so if you kind of think about areas where microbes like to survive, there's this kind of, you know, shielded area around that vent, there's little spurts of gas coming out every now and then, it might be a little bit warmer or a little bit more humid than just a random surface on the outside of station. So we really think that if we're going to find anything anywhere, that those kind of locations are where, where we think we might find them, it's like – like, where you kind of have to think about like where…    Host: Like mold forms in your house?  Aaron Regberg: …where mold would grow in your house, yeah.  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Aaron Regberg: It's the warm dark kind of places…  Host: That's what I'm thinking.  Aaron Regberg: …that you don't, that you don't go that often.    Host: And it, does the Sun have anything to do with it, because I like, I'm, I'm assuming like, in these areas the Sun wouldn't shine, so would that be favorable to microbes to grow?    Aaron Regberg: Yeah, so ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is a, is pretty good at, at sterilizing and killing a lot of microbes in space. So yeah, anywhere where we can find some, some sort of shady spots and protected spots are, are more likely to, to have microbial populations.    Host: OK. All right. So in terms of the, the full kit, the, the actual pieces of scientific hardware and, and tools that they're actually going to bring out to this vent when they, when they bring it out, what exactly, you mentioned some swab kits, you mentioned all of that, but what exactly is, is going to be part of their bag that they're taking out to the work site?   Aaron Regberg: So, it's, it's this box, basically, and it's got canisters kind of set into it, and the box is -- I always tell people it's about the size of a breadbox, but I know that's not a great reference anymore -- but it's, it's like, you know, kind of a foot by six inches.   Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: And there are these metal canisters inset in it and, and each inside, each canister is a swab that kind of looks like a giant version of the swabs that we've all been sticking up our nose for, for COVID tests for the past few years.   Host: [laughter] OK.  Aaron Regberg: It's a, it's actually a commercially-available swab that's designed to take a sample from the inside of your cheek.   Host: Interesting.  Aaron Regberg: So the head of the swab is about the size of a nickel.    Host: Oh, OK. That's a little bigger than the stuff they put up your nose for COVID.   Aaron Regberg: Yeah, yeah. A little bigger because, and that's, so it's easier for the astronauts to work with in the spacesuit gloves because those are kind of clunky and hard to manipulate things.    Host: OK. So that, that was probably a huge consideration, what, like, make sure it's not terribly fine where they would have…  Aaron Regberg: Yeah.   Host: …to really strain their fingers to do it.    Aaron Regberg: Yeah. And so they have a big a big handle that is actually a, a repurposed piece of equipment that was used to repair tiles on the space shuttle if they needed to.  Host: Oh, OK.   Aaron Regberg: And so, you plug that handle into one of the canisters and you pull out the swab and you take your, you know, you swab your surface, just like they do on the inside of space station or just like you would use a Q-tip to kind of clean a little corner in your bathroom or something, and then you pop that swab back into the canister and the canister has a, a hermetic seal at the top. And at the bottom there's a, a filter and the, the filter is made out of Teflon and the, the pore sizes are smaller than most of the bacteria that we find on Earth. That, the pore size is 0.2 microns. And that filter is really important because the canister has to be able to equalize pressure with the outside environment, so it has to be able to go to vacuum.    Host: Oh yeah.     Aaron Regberg: If it was, if it was completely sealed up and there was no vent on it, you would take it outside and you would open it and there would be this little, you know, puff of gas. And that's a safety concern I think, because if you didn't have it put together correctly, you know, it could pop the top off and things could go floating out into space.     Host: I was going to say, it can compromise the whole canister too, maybe, right?   Aaron Regberg: Yeah, yeah. So we put this filter stack on the bottom.  Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: And that lets it equalize pressure when we take it out, and it also lets it equalize pressure when we come back in. But it'll keep whatever microbes that we collected in there: they'll, they'll, they won't make it through the filter. Hopefully they'll stay stuck to the swab, but if they don't, they'll end up on that, on that filter.    Host: OK. Yeah. It's just for, it's just for the pressure and no microbes are going to escape it.   Aaron Regberg: Yeah.  Host: OK. That's a cool design. And I like the handle design too because you don't have to like pinch that little swab or anything.   Aaron Regberg: Yeah.   Host: You got this big handle to help you maneuver it in a, in a bulky spacesuit. That's a, that's a very interesting design.    Aaron Regberg: Yeah. Credit to the tools engineers for that. That's, they, they came up with that, that idea.     Host: Very cool. OK. So they got the, the handles for each of those, the swabs are actually going to go in the vent. Then you got one that you just stick up into the vacuum of space and put down, and one that you leave, and that's your eight.    Aaron Regberg: Yep. And that's all eight. Yep.    Host: All right. And so, yeah, so it's this big box. OK, so then what happens? After you do your samples, you bring it back in the airlock?   Aaron Regberg: Yep. We bring it back inside. We have to take, there's a whole bunch of attachment points on the outside of that box so that, you know, the astronauts have a bunch of different ways to tether it to their suit or attach it to their suit so they have an easy way to work with it. We have to take up, we have to have the astronauts take all those off so that it will fit in the freezer that's on space station. So we're going to freeze the entire box at minus 80 Celsius; that's a temperature that works really well for preserving microbes and preserving DNA.   Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: And it's just going to sit in the freezer until we get a ride back on a SpaceX vehicle, and it'll come back in a special, like a, it's like a, they call it a cold or a double cold bag. It's like a really fancy, soft cooler with special ice packs in it so that it stays frozen all the way back to Earth.   Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: And then we'll get it back here to JSC and we'll bring it into our labs, and we will take those, those swabs apart and extract DNA, and then work with some collaborators to, to try to sequence that DNA.    Host: I'm guessing the DNA sequencing process is a little more complicated, which is why you didn't opt for the on-orbit DNA sequencer.    Aaron Regberg: It is, yeah. One of, actually one of the, one of the problems with the onboard DNA sequencer is we've optimized all of our processes to work with those really small swabs…  Host: Yeah.  Aaron Regberg: …that they use inside, and we actually don't have a procedure for how to get a big swab processed and onto that sequencer.   Host: Interesting.  Aaron Regberg: So that was something where we kind of looked at it and I talked with, with Sarah Wallace, who's one of the scientists that, that helps to, to design operations for that sequencer on space, and she's actually on this project as well, and we both kind of decided that it would just be simpler and more effective to try to do it on Earth.   Host: OK.   Aaron Regberg: And the sequencers that we have on Earth, the sequencer that is in space is amazing, but like a lot of things, the sequencers that we have on Earth, the instruments that we have on Earth, are sometimes a little bit more sensitive than what we can afford to fly to space because of mask constraints and, and things like that. So we thought we'd have our best chance of detecting something if we did, at least the first time, all of the work on the ground.   Host: OK.   Aaron Regberg: If we get an opportunity to do this again, and if this becomes part of a sort of routine monitoring package, we will try to figure out how to do the analysis in space.    Host: OK. Yeah. So it's, it, it definitely goes beyond just swab size as the reason for going to the ground. It's, you have better instrumentation, you can, you can have a lot more confidence in your scientific results. Yeah. That, that's what I, that was going to be my next question was the, the repetition of this. Obviously, you're got, you have the six samples plus the two controls. It's, you know, that's, that's a decent sample size, but it sounds like you, you definitely want more to have the more confidence, right? So…  Aaron Regberg: Yeah, we'd like to replicate the experiment and, and then the sort of long term thought that we have is that this may become part of something that we just ask astronauts to do routinely to verify that all of our equipment is working correctly. So, for example, if you send someone to Mars and you're worried about contamination and you've installed filters or, or whatever, you still need to be able to, to make some measurement to understand that the whole system is working correctly. And so you could, you could use this swab in that situation as well to make sure that you weren't accidentally leaking microbes out of a, a filtered vent, for example.    Host: OK. That could be part of routine Mars operations.  Aaron Regberg: Routine Mars operations. Yeah. It's something we're considering, you know, maybe asking people to try practicing with on, on Artemis.  Host: Oh, yeah. You would, can do the same thing there.   Aaron Regberg: You can do the same thing on the surface of the Moon, just to kind of get people familiar with it. It, it also just helps to understand, you know, as, as a curator, we spend a lot of time thinking about contamination and worrying about contamination, and we do everything to the best of our ability to make sure there is no contamination. That's kind of an impossible task. There's always going to be some kind of contamination. So it's important from a science, a science perspective to try to characterize, you know, you do the best you can to make sure there's no contamination, but then you try to characterize whatever, whatever gets through your controls anyway so that you, you have a really clear picture of what, you know, what is a real scientific signal that you're measuring and what is, is maybe from, from a contaminant.    Host: What does sequencing the, the microbes help you to do? Like, you can identify where, where the microbes came from, what are the most, what are the best that could survive very harsh conditions? What are you looking for?  Aaron Regberg: Potentially, yeah. So at a, at the most basic level, DNA sequencing will help us identify what microbes were present in the sample. So were there bacteria, were there fungi, were there some other kind of organism that we weren't expecting? If we have enough DNA we can try to sequence not just genes that let us identify who is there, but genes that tell us about what those organisms are capable of metabolically. So can they breathe oxygen or are they like those weird bacteria that I studied in grad[uate] school that can breathe iron and don't need any oxygen? That requires collecting more biomass usually, so we're not sure we're going to be able to do that type of sequencing, but the goal would be to, to paint as clear a picture as possible of what microorganisms were present in the sample and what types of metabolisms they're capable of employing. So what kind of foods do they like to eat, what kind of things do they need to breathe, things like that, and that would help us understand where they came from.  As a sort of first order, we'll, we'll compare to what we know is on the inside of space station. So they do microbial monitoring routinely inside station, there have been DNA sequencing experiments that happen in there, so we have a big list and database of, sort of, here are the things that we know are always around inside station. And so if we see those outside, it's, it's the most logical explanation is that they came from the inside.    Host: Do you believe that, you know, we're doing this experiment on the International Space Station, you mentioned that it could help us a lot with exploring other planets, Mars, namely; do you believe it would, the knowledge we gained from this would transfer nice, nicely to the surface of Mars? Meaning, the bacteria that likely grow in the vacuum of space would more or less maybe be the same that would grow on the surface of Mars in a completely different atmosphere and environment? Or is there a possibility that, you know, different things could grow? Does it translate nicely?    Aaron Regberg: It's not, yeah, that's a good question; it's not, it's not one to one.   Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: But the things that make it hard to, for bacteria to grow in space, you know, in low-Earth orbit, are not completely different from the things that make it hard for bacteria to grow on the surface of Mars. So in low-Earth orbit, you have a lot of ultraviolet radiation to deal with; that's also a, a problem on the surface of Mars. You know, in low-Earth orbit you have no oxygen; on the surface of Mars, you have very, very little oxygen. So it's not exactly the same, but it's similar. The pressure on the surface of Mars is a lot lower than the pressure on Earth, not as low as vacuum but it's a lot lower.   Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: So it's, it's similar. So you might expect to see similar types of microorganisms, but you, you know, ones that are adapted to be able to handle not having a lot of water around and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and, and things like that. You know, big temperature swings; but it's not, it's not a given that would be the exact same species.    Host: OK. When the samples go down to the ground, how do you, how do you handle them in terms of your, you have it, you said you met, you have them in this special, I think you said double coldbox, but how, how does, you transfer it, how do you transfer it from the spacecraft and then get it over to a facility and get it into a DNA sequencer? What does that process look like?    Aaron Regberg: I'm learning a little bit about that myself. I'm not…  Host: Cool.  Aaron Regberg: …I'm not entirely sure, but my, my, there's a whole group at NASA called Cold Stowage, and this is their entire job is to make sure that stuff stays at the right temperature on the way up and on the way down. So they're, they're going to be in charge of unpacking the spacecraft and making sure it stays the right temperature until they're ready to hand it over to us.  Host: OK.  Aaron Regberg: And then when they hand it over to us, we will, it, it, it's a chemical extraction process and I, and I'm not sure we've totally decided yet how, which, which process we're going to use to get the DNA out. But you basically take that swab and you, you, you peel it off the stick, and put it into a, a, a test tube, and you add different, different compounds and, and heat it up and agitate it to try to break open the cells. And then that DNA goes into the, to the liquid that you've added to the test tube. And then there are a bunch more steps to kind of clean that DNA up and get it into the right configuration that you can put it onto the sequencer.    Host: OK. But is there, like, the different techniques, do they have different levels of sensitivity or…  Aaron Regberg: Yeah, that's, that's what it is. There are, there are different ways to do it. Some of them are optimized for different types of microorganisms, some of them are, are optimized for different size fragments of DNA, so the length of the DNA that, that comes out at the end of that process. And so we're going to, we have some ideas about how we want to do that, but we're going to, we're going to talk to our collaborators. The DNA sequencing is a really, really rapidly evolving field. So even what we wrote, you know, we submitted this proposal to do this work in 2019, and even the ideas that we had about what we might want to do with the samples in terms of the details of how we were going to extract the DNA and do the sequencing in 2019 are kind of outdated at this point.    Host: Interesting.   Aaron Regberg: It's like if you, it's, it's evolving as fast as, you know, you get new computers, right? So if you, if you had a computer from 2019 today in, in 2023, it's like, kind of old and slow and not very exciting, and you'd want to do your work on the, you know, play your game or whatever on the, the newest, best machine. And that's kind of what we want to do here too.   Host: Yeah.  Aaron Regberg: So that's why, if it sounds like I'm being vague, it's because we want to take advantage of whatever we think is the best technology available when, when we actually have the sample in our hand to do the work.    Host: That's, that's good though that, I mean, you're, you're, you're planning for this, you have techniques down, but it sounds like it, it's very adaptable in terms of how you can approach the, you know, in actually getting to sequence the, the DNA here. That's a, that's a pretty cool experiment, if, if you can just kind of kind of roll with whatever is the latest and greatest.   Aaron Regberg: That’s our hope, yeah.    Host: Yeah. That's really great. You know, this is, this is just an absolutely fascinating kind of experiment that you, that you guys are doing but, I wonder, you, you mentioned you came from industry and started with the oil and gas and now, you're, you're here and working on a mission like this, right, you're thinking about, you're working on the International Space Station, you're thinking about the, you know, the contamination environment for different planets. I just wonder just, you know, looking at your, just your job now and what you're doing, as a whole, how do you, how do you feel about it?    Aaron Regberg: I mean, I'm, I'm really excited about it. It's fun to be, it's fun to be involved in these conversations and there are, it's a really long time scale.  But I don't know, I, I really like the idea that the work that, that I'm doing and the work that the people I'm, I'm working with are doing is, is setting up other people for success. So if we, if we do a good job of, of minimizing contamination or preventing contamination, it's going to, it's going to make it really easy, or hopefully easier, for another scientist to come along after me and look for life on Mars or, you know, understand how the solar system formed because they have these really great samples to work with. And I, I don't know, I get a lot of personal satisfaction out of that. This is, the work that I'm doing is, is, is setting up the next person to be really successful or to find something cool.    Host: Oh, that's awesome. Do you see yourself sticking with this kind of project for a while, meaning, you know, it sounds like there's a chance that this could evolve and you could be doing something very similar with, with different spacecraft that are on and around the Moon, gearing up for, for a Mars mission; do you see yourself sticking with this or do you kind of want to set a good example, pass it on to the next guy, and maybe do try something new?    Aaron Regberg: I don't know. Yeah, we'll see. We'll have to see how it goes.   Host: Yeah. Follow…what was your advice? It was, follow whatever you're interested in.   Aaron Regberg: Yeah.  Host: Yeah, yeah.   Aaron Regberg: Yeah. I think that'll, that'll probably be my strategy.    Host: Whatever comes up. All right. That's really cool. Well, Aaron, this was an, this was so cool to be able to talk to you and, I know this is going to be launching pretty soon to the International Space Station, so I'm very excited and I really hope the, the timeliners can squeeze it in to the, a very, a spacewalk that's coming up in the very near future so you can, you can do this sooner rather than later. This is, this is going to be pretty exciting. So, Aaron Regberg, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. What a pleasure talking to you today.   Aaron Regberg: Thanks a lot. Yeah, this has been really fun.    [Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I hope you learned something today. It was really a pleasure to talk to Dr. Aaron Regberg today.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  Episode 71: Apollo and the Moon.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So if you're familiar with us, this is where we bring in scientists, engineers, astronauts, all the coolest people to tell you all the cool stuff about NASA.  We explore a lot about human space flight and dive deep into so many topics.  So we're celebrating 50 years since the era of the Apollo missions to the moon.  And there was a lot of political drive behind this initiative.  But there was also some fascinating science.  And it may not look like much, but the moon is full of stories.  Stories about how the earth formed.  Stories of fire and energy.  And there's a very interesting perspective on exploring the moon.  We haven't been since 1972, but there's still so much that we're learning about this celestial body.  And there's plenty of reason to go back.  To give different perspectives on the moon, we have Jennifer Ross-Nazzal and John Gruener.  Jennifer is the resident historian here are the Johnson Space Center.  And can explain in-depth the history of the Apollo program and the first journey to the moon.  Much of it of how and why.   John Gruener is a planetary scientist.  Has been on the podcast before to talk about [inaudible] resource utilization or living off the land.  Basically using the environment to create things you need like fuel, water, or building materials.  So today we're going to go back in time and explore the Apollo program and what it took for humans to land on the moon.  And then we'll discover what we learned about our planet—about our nearest celestial body to our planet from John Gruener.  History can be a great way to learn how to do things better in the future.  So we'll use some of this knowledge to explore the missions ahead.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal and Mr. John Gruener.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Jennifer and John, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.    John Gruener: Sure, my pleasure.    Host: This is an interesting topic because I usually we stick with one, and John, you're familiar because you came on the podcast before.  You, when you came on here, we talked about living off the land, [inaudible] resource utilization.  Using what you got on the land to create stuff that you need.  But this one is a little bit of a mix because with all the Apollo anniversaries coming up.  I kind of wanted to explore not only the history and really get into that.  And Jennifer, I'm so excited to have you here.  Because the JSC historian?  Oh my gosh!  I have so many questions.  But also the science.  You know?  Not only did we go there, but there's so much that we learned and we're still learning with the moon rocks.  Even with our conversation with Ryan Ziegler not too far, not too long ago.  I forget which podcast episode that was.  But yeah, we, there's still so much to learn.  So this is going to be interesting.  I wanted to start with the history first.  So Jennifer, if you want to kind of, kind of launch it off.  We're going to the moon, right?  And this is, there's a lot of reasons why we're going to the moon.  Back in the Apollo era in the '60s, we have, you know, John F Kennedy.  After 15 minutes of spaceflight experience on the Mercury program.  John F Kennedy stands up there and says, \"Cool!  We're going to the moon now.\"  And it's this kind of political drive.  Was that the main reason why we decided, you know, the moon.  Was, was it mainly the politics?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well I think when you're talking about Apollo, you really need to think about like you've said, the circumstances of the time period.  And it was more than just politics.  Really, you need to think at the broader picture.  The Cold War that was happening at that time.  The Soviet Union was well ahead of the United States in terms of space at that point.  Yes, we had just sent Alan Shepherd to space.  We had 15 minutes of space, like you said.  But the Soviets had launched several successful satellites well before we did.  We had a lot of very public problematic launches.  And a lot of people questioned whether or not we were capable of doing what we said we were going to do.  The Soviets, of course every launch was very secret.  We were a very public agency.  So people got to see all of our failures on the public stage.  And so you know Kennedy is trying to think of how we might best the Soviet Union.  You know, what's the best way?  How can we catch up?  We're, we're always seemingly behind.   And so this is the best way.  By coming up with a new plan.  You know, NASA had been studying how we might get to the moon.  But this is an accelerated plan.  He wants to get there by the end of the decade.  And Bob Gilruth who ends up becoming Center Director here at the Manned Spacecraft Center.  Remembers listening to the president.  He was actually flying to Tulsa for a meeting.  And he remembers hearing the President.  And saying he was aghast at these ides-- this idea that we were actually going to go to the moon by the end of the decade.  Because he was going to be responsible for achieving that goal.  And so far, all we had was 15 minutes in space.    Host: Right.  I'm sure he had a sort of a course in mind, based on the progress that it would take.  To I don't know, continue to evolve human space flight.  But this definitely accelerated the plans.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely.  Yeah, there was a, there was a lot that had to be achieved by the end of the decade.  You know, they, they had been studying how to get to the moon.  They weren't really sure how to do it.  We've, we've done a lot of interviews with engineers who were working on that.  And, and they, they asked Bob Gilruth, \"Well, how are we going to do that?\"  “I don't know, but that's your job.  Go out and figure out how we're going to get to the moon.”  And now suddenly here we are.  We've got, we've got a deadline.    Host: Yeah.  So before, so before we start looping in the science.  Let's continue with some of the history.  So now we have this proclamation.  We're going to the moon.  What are the next steps?  How did it accelerate to, to, to make sure we were going to make that, that deadline?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, well, you know, there were a lot of things that we had to figure out.  We had to determine, what was the mode that we were going to take to the moon?  We weren't really sure how we were going to get there.  The original idea was something that was called direct ascent.  And that was taking this huge rocket known as Nova.  And just flying directly to the moon, and then flying back to earth.  And you know people thought that was a great idea.  But the problem was it was too heavy.  It was going to be way too expensive.  And it was going to take way too long.  But that idea was being discussed for, for you know, many months.  And then there were also two other ideas that were bounced around.  One was Earth Orbit Rendezvous which was taking up two vehicles.  They were going to launch separately.  And they were going to rendezvous and dock in space.  And then they were going to go to the moon.  A lot of people at Marshall really liked that idea.  And then there was another idea that was put forth by people at Langley.  And that's the mode that we ended up using which was Lunar Orbit Rendezvous.   And that actually, that idea was not very popular at first.  The advocates of that actually tried to appeal to headquarters.  Quite often people at the Manned Spacecraft Center initially were not big fans of it.  Eventually they did end up adopting that idea.  Because it was much easier.  It didn't require as much technological work.  It only required one launch.  It enabled the agency to come up with spacecraft specific for earth orbit.  Lunar orbit, and then we had a lunar lander that we could build specifically just for landing on the moon.  And we also didn't need to bring it back.  So it wasn't as much weight as the Direct Ascent rocket that we would have sent.  So we had to come up with that.  That was one of the things that we had to come up with.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, we had to train astronauts.  We had to hire more astronauts.  There were a lot of things that had to be done.  Human spaceflight.  Also when NASA was formed, a lot of people thought it was a fad.  Someone, Hugh Dryden, for instance likened it to shooting a lady out of a cannon.  A lot of people who worked for the space task group were very young.  We've interviewed a lot of people who talked about how they were discouraged by their mentors at Langley from taking positions with the space task group because they said.  When human spaceflight is done, you're not going to have a job back here.  So they really tried to discourage them from taking those jobs.    Host: Oh, wow.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But they were of course very excited about this new opportunity.  This new field.  And so of course we need a new center.  As soon as Kennedy announced that we were going to the moon.  We need a human spaceflight center.  Where we're going to train these astronauts.  Where we're going to house the operations.  So we start looking for a new facility in which we can do all of these things.  Which eventually becomes the Manned Spacecraft Center here in Houston.  What's known as the Johnson Space Center today.    Host: Yeah, and it's because Lyndon B Johnson had a great deal to do with getting it here, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, you know, interestingly enough.  A lot of people like to say that.  And it's great because we're here in the Johnson Room here in Houston.    Host: Yeah, I thought it was appropriate.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, it's totally appropriate.  But there's, there's a name that most people don't often associate with human spaceflight.  And that's Albert Thomas.  You may recognize the name from the post office on El Camino here in Houston?    Host: Okay.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And at the time he was head of the House Appropriations Committee.  And he had been for years actually trying to get the Atomic Energy Commission to build a center on this site.  And they were interested.  So when NASA was established.  He started appealing to the first administrator.  And there weren't any plans to build a center here in Houston.  They were building one out in D.C. in Greenbelt.  And he actually threatened the administrator.  He said he wasn't going to give him any money to build that center unless he moved it to Houston.  And eventually, there's a lot of politicking going on.  Once they make the decision that they're going to build a center somewhere in the United States dedicated to human spaceflight.  There's a lot of politicking going on between Albert Thomas because he holds the purse strings for NASA.  We have a lot of Houston boosters like George R Brown.  You recognize his name.  He's got a company, he's a big supporter of Lyndon B Johnson.  Lyndon Johnson, as you pointed out, is the Vice President at the time.  And there's a lot of other people, folks at Rice in particular who were very interested in having a NASA center come to Houston.   So there's a lot of behind the scenes politicking going on.  Trying to bring a center here.  And they actually do visit about 23 sites all over the United States.  Places like Boston and Tampa.  Tampa is actually the number-one choice of NASA.  At MacDill Air Force Base.    Host: Really?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, originally it was the number-one choice.  Houston was number two.  So we end up coming here primarily I think because of Albert Thomas.  Not necessarily Johnson.  Johnson, I think, played a role.  But not as big of a roll are Thomas because he had those purse strings.    Host: Interesting.  Where's the Thomas Room?    John Gruener: Congressman from Houston, Texas.  And Sam Rayburn also from Texas was Speaker of the House.  So there was a strong Texas connection to why this place wound up where it is.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely.  And Olin Teague. I mean there's, there's.  We, we tend not to have a very strong Texas delegation these days.  But in the '60s, Texas had a lot of sway in Congress.  And if you have a lot of power in Congress, you can bring home the bacon to your constituents.  And so you know it was a really exciting time for the folks here in Houston.  You know, they got that space fever bug.  But you know we, we had to build new facilities and you know.  A lot, a lot of things were going on.    Host: Because the Clear Lake area wasn't really built up yet, right?  And so they kind of picked this plot of land.  And then all of a sudden create jobs.  Things start growing, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely, yeah.  It met all the requirements that NASA was looking for.  They needed at 1000 acres of land.  And if you look at photos from that time period.  There really wasn't anything on it.  A lot of people joked that they were told well you know, there are alligators on the property.  And when they came out-- because they, they actually invited people from Langley to come out and take what they call look-and-see trips.  They actually flew them out here to decide whether or not they were going to move here.  Because a lot of people were like Houston?  They didn't want to move to Houston.    Host: It’s hot.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: They thought Houston was a bad place to live.  A hurricane had just hit.    Host: Oh yeah. That won’t sell it.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: No.  Absolutely not.  So they weren't really thrilled about it.  But you know people came out and took trips.  And in no way was Clear Lake developed at that time.  It was really a rural area.  Webster had like a one-light stoplight.  And you know a general store, and that was kind of it.  There was a lot of fishing going on, a lot of shrimping, and not much else.  So you know Houston was about 20 miles up.  And even when people did move here, they had to go into Houston to go shopping.  To go out to eat.  There just wasn't a lot of development going on.  But once NASA says we're going to build here.  The company actually that, that donated the land which was donated to Rice.  It's sort of this big Texas deal.  You see the areas start to develop.  You see Clear Lake City develop.  You see Nassau Bay across the street start to develop.  So there's a lot of changes that happened as a result of NASA coming down here.    Host: Lot of growth.  And the reason that they wanted this center was primarily astronaut training.  Was it, was it Mission Control?  What were the primary reasons?  Primary, I guess, functions.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: The space task group was attached to the Langley Research Center.  And they wanted a separate center for human spaceflight.  It just really wasn't—    Host: Human spaceflight?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Human spaceflight, absolutely.  And so they needed a new center.  There were discussion about where to put Mission Control.  They weren't sure Mission Control was actually going to come here to JSC initially.  But they convinced the administrator to bring it here.  But yes, they needed a place to train astronauts.  They needed a place to put our engineers.  And they wanted the astronauts and engineers to work closely together on things like interfaces.  We also needed things like you realize we're close to the water.  So they wanted to bring in spacecraft by barge.  Houston was a great place to do that.  They also needed a convenient airport.  We have an airport just up the road.  They also wanted universities.  They wanted to live in a, in a place that was full of a, a vibrant cultural community.  Houston definitely was.  So you know Houston had a lot of perks.    Host: Alright.  At what point did, in the program, maybe it was when we decided we were going to the moon.  That the Lunar Curations facility started coming into play.  That this was going to be the place where moon rocks would be.    John Gruener: Right, because it was all focused on the humans, right?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: Kennedy said we're going to send man to the moon and return him safely before the decade out.  And there was nothing in there about and while he's there, he's going to pick up rocks and bring them back to, you know.  It was all about the humans and getting them back safely.  But you know as, as the training progressed and as, as we went through Mercury and Gemini, we get into Apollo and then people start planning for an actual surface excursion, you know?  It's, it's when I, my first degree was in aerospace engineering.  Because I thought it was all about that cool flight back and forth, you know, to the moon.  And the spacecraft and the rockets.  But really, you have to ask yourself well, why are you even going to the moon, right?  This was obviously very political, geopolitical driven thing.  But, but nowadays, we ask ourselves why are we going back to the moon?  Or why are we going to Mars?  And it's all about what you're going to do on the surface, right?  And if you don't really have any plans to do something on the surface, well then why go in the first place?  But it was reversed during the Apollo.  So we, we were going to the moon.  So since we are going to the moon, what are we going to do when we get there?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And the obvious thing was geologic field work.  So NASA brought in a geoscientist also worked with the United States Geological Survey, USGS.  To train the astronauts in geologic field work.  What to look for.  How to employ long-lived scientific instruments.  And then they decided okay, well, we're bringing these rocks back and they're on this moon with no atmosphere, right?  No oxygen to interact with the rocks.  So and you're bringing it to Houston with a very humid atmosphere.  Host: Oh yeah.  John Gruener: Right?  Lots of water in our atmosphere here.  So what are the specifications?  What do we need to do to protect these rocks?  And so lot of work went into what we now have as the Apollo Sample Curation Facility.  You mentioned you talked to Ryan Ziegler.  He's running that now.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So yeah, science was very much, I won't say it's an afterthought.  But it came later in the, the process of, of getting to the moon.  And we're going to bring these rocks back, so we need to protect them.  We need the science labs to understand the rocks.  We did have Rice University, University of Houston just right up the road.  You know?  And a lot of the early scientists came from those institutions.  I don't know if you've ever talked to Dr. Wendell Mindell but he was here during Apollo.  He grew up a Houston boy.  Went to Rice, then went out to Caltech.  Well, went to Caltech first, then he went to Rice.  But so you know we, we drew.  You talked about one of the draws for why would the manned space center be here?  Well, we had these two university systems.  That we could pull from.  So you know the, the Lunar Sample Curation Facility started being designed.  But, but even before that from the science prospective it was like, and the safety prospective.  So we're going to land on this moon.  Is it just a dusty surface?  And we're going to sink into this bowl of dust?  And our astronauts aren't going to be able to get off, right?  So we had to send robotic missions to the moon to answer these, not only the lunar environment questions.  But lunar science questions.  You know, very simple thing.  Is the moon an intact surface that you can actually land on?  And walk on?  And work on?  And what a lot of people don't realize is we successfully sent 13 robots to the moon before Neil Armstrong ever set foot there, right?  So the Ranger program was basically a, a big camera.  Almost like a, you know, telescope.  And it just came closer and closer to the moon.  And it kept sending back pictures until it crashed into the moon, right?  A lot of those early Ranger missions didn't work, right.  We, we talked about our failures were right there in, in the public's view, right?  So in all we tried to send about 20 missions to the moon.  But only 13 of them succeeded.  Right?  And that was okay for robotic missions.  But that kind of success rate wouldn't work for humans, right?  13 out of 20.  But after the Rangers slammed into the moon, gave us our first up-close views.  Then we had some lunar orbiters that went into orbit around the moon.  They started taking high-resolution images to pick landing sites.  And then the surveyor landers actually went down and actually touched, landed on the surface of the moon.  Showed that it was competent.  You could walk and work there.  Even had a alpha particle X-ray spectrometer which measure the chemistry of the, on, on the surface of the moon.  Those up-front, those cameras right there in front of the field of surveyor gave us an idea of what the surface was like.  It kind of looked like you know a beach.  Sandy, gravel-y stuff.  So there was a lot of science going on behind the scenes while the humans were in the spotlight.    Host: Right.  So I mean just to, to understand the moon.  Does that, that takes a lot of energy to, to get up there.  Even those robotic missions, maybe smaller rockets, but now you want to send humans.  And like you said with this lunar rendezvous profile, Jennifer.  That's, you're talking about large spacecraft, multiple space, spacecraft.  You need a giant rocket.  So that's when the Saturn V starts coming in, right?  So what was the story there?  To actually make this lunar, this human lunar mission possible?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, yeah.  I mean, we needed, we needed a large rocket.  And Marshall Space Flight Center was heavily involved in developing that Saturn rocket.  And you know what, it didn't need to be as large as that Nova rocket that we talked about for Direct Ascent.  But that was, that was something that they, they worked on.  The German engineers out there at Marshall Space Flight Center.  Here at, at JSC, we were more focused on things like building the spacecraft itself.  So the command module that you see the astronauts working and living in.  As they go to the moon and return back home.  That's really the only thing that gets to come back also from the moon.  And also working on that lunar lander, the lunar module that ends up traveling down to the moon's surface.  And the astronauts live in while they're on the lunar surface.  So you know there's a lot of work that needs to be done.  And there's a lot of contractor all across the United States that were working on this program.  And also universities.  People like at MIT who were working on different projects.   So there, there were thousands of people who worked on the Apollo program.  You know, just people that, that you might not associate with the Apollo program.  People—seamstresses who were sewing space suits for instances, and gloves that the astronauts wore on the moon.    Host: Oh yeah.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So you know, there are, there are a lot of people involved in this program.  I think a lot of the, the people that we often think of and associate with Apollo are the people that get the most attention.  Who appear on these magazine covers like the astronauts, of course, on life magazine.  Or you might see Chris Kraft who was on the cover of Time Magazine.  All the Mission Control folks before we had TV.  And on the spacecraft we would see what was happening in Mission Control.  That's where all the action was.  But you know we don't often think about all the engineers and the scientists and all the other people who made this program successful.    Host: Right.  And there was with so many people involved.  You said there was a lot of designing, design work going on here, right?  For the command module.  Was the lunar module here too?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.    Host: Okay, do you know if the picking up moon rocks, as John was describing was part of the design.  Or was it designed for a function and you fit the moon rocks in there?    John Gruener: It was exactly that.    Host: It was the second one?    John Gruener: So, yes.  So we have this spacecraft.  How many suitcases can we take with this, right?  It's like you're planning on a trip.  You just kind of know that there's these overhead bins in the airplane that you can fit your suitcases in, right?  So once the ascent module, the lunar module that would come off of the moon.  And once the command module, once that volume was kind of set and they started putting things in.  It was like okay, now how many suitcases of rocks can we fit in?    Host: Yeah.  Okay.  Now after, of, of course the first Apollo, Apollo XI landing.  That was of fairly short duration, right?  A few hours, I think they were actually walking on the moon?  And collecting rocks and just putting it in there?  But the new technologies started coming out with some of the later missions, right?  Now we have a rover.  I don't know, was there more capability to bring more rocks back?  What was evolving at the time?    John Gruener: Well, there was.    Host: Okay.    John Gruener: So you know, you talked about the size of the Saturn V, and I you know one of my buds in the Apollo in the astronaut office is Don Petit, and I know you've talked with Don Petit a couple of times on this podcast.  And he likes to talk about this thing called the tyranny of the rocket equation.  I don't know if you've heard that from him.  But when you're an aerospace engineer in college.  You learn all about the rocket equation.  And that basically tells you, you know, how fast you have to get moving to get off of the earth and escape earth's gravity.  And get to the moon.  And then how much you need to slow down to get in orbit around the moon.  And then you have to, okay, I got this, the velocity's worked out.  Now I'm trying to send a, a certain amount of mass to the moon.  The spacecraft, the people.  And so mass is a part of that rocket equation.  And the huge chunk of mass is the propellant.  You know, so now that you know the velocities you need.  How much mass you're trying to get somewhere.  Now you can figure out how much propellant you need.  And it was like 80% or so of that big, tall rocket.  Standing on the launchpads during Apollo.  80— , 75-80% of that was just propellant, right?  So the, this rocket equation.  You know, the tyranny of the rocket equation.  It all based on physics.  And of course physics haven't changed since Apollo, so we're still fighting it today.  And, and probably some of you know the biggest breakthrough is with this company called SpaceX. Where now they are reusing their booster stages.  Well, they'll, they'll launch off the pad and then they'll reuse their booster stage.  So you know you save the, the high-technology parts that the rocket engines, the fuel tanks and stuff.  But still, you've going to fill it up with a bunch of propellant because it, it just takes a lot of propellant to get the mass you're trying to get out there.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And then, I think I talked to you, when we were doing the Living Off the Land podcast, you know.  A lot of equations here at NASA, most of them extremely long with a lot of variables.  But the most important equation's real simple.  Mass equals money.  And if you want to send Apollo astronauts to the moon on a huge Saturn V that's just massive.  You have to have massive amounts of money, right?  So the, the Rangers, the surveyors, the lunar orbiters, the smaller spacecraft are a lot easier to get there.  A lot cheaper to get there.  So it's, it's, it's a huge commitment when you're talking about human spaceflight.  And you know, Kennedy, you know, people focus on the technology a lot.  But the cost of Apollo was incredible.  Sometimes up to four percent of the federal budget.  And, and Kennedy realized that.  And he said, \"You know, this is going to wrack some of our social programs.  I understand that.  But this is the second-most important thing as a nation we need to be doing right now.\"    Host: Yeah.  Because it was, because it was ultimately you know it wasn't just get to the moon and pick up rocks.  Which was scientifically astounding.  But at the same time, we had to beat the Soviet Union.  That was a, that was a huge part of it.    John Gruener: And when you're doing things for the first time, you know, from the engineering standpoint, you throw in a lot of margin, right?  So mass margin.  Propulsion margin.  Delta V, change in velocity margin.  And as you are flying these missions to the moon, you start understanding it better.  And so the, our last three missions, Apollo XV, XVI, and XVII, that's where we got the little electric cars that you talked about.  You know, buggies to drive around.  All of that increased capability on the surface of the moon, and bringing more mass to the surface of the moon.  Was because now that we understand our rockets better, we can release some of that margin and actually use it as payload.  So same rocket, but we just understand it better.  So now we can spend three days on the moon instead of one day.  We can bring a little electric car with us.  And we can bring back, you know, close to 100 kilograms of rocks and soil.  Where the first Apollo XI, they brought back a few, you know, tens of kilograms.  So it was an order of magnitude change with the Apollos XV, XVI, and XVII.  And that was all based on understanding our, our rockets better.    Host: Yeah.  So, so to make that possible, Jennifer.  I know like so the whole, NASA as a whole as John said was funneling a lot of money just into the Apollo program.  Is, was you know what percent of all of the agency was just Apollo?  And was, was there just less going on at NASA that allowed us to funnel more money into that single program?  Compared to now with all the different programs we have?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, there were definitely other programs going on.  We did have people looking at space stations very early on.  NASA always wanted a space station.  So there were people looking at future programs.  You know, we, in the middle of working on Apollo, we were still working on Gemini, sending folks up there.  We had been working on Mercury.  We also started working on the Apollo applications program.  Which became known as Skylab.  When we launched Apollo XI, we actually had people working on the design of the space shuttle.  So money was, was being spent on other programs.  And of course you know we used a lot of money for facilities.  I think John was talking a little bit about bringing the lunar curatorial facility online.  When we originally built the Manned Spacecraft Center, that wasn't one of the, the buildings that was built.  No one thought about well, okay, we're going to go to the moon.  What are we going to do with these rocks?   Most of the people working here thought this was an engineering problem.  We need to send men to the moon.  We need to figure out how we're going to do it.  Size was sort of like oh yeah, kind of a moment.  And so we didn't actually start thinking about what we were going to do with those rocks.  Until later when we brought those geoscientists onboard.  And they said of course we're going to the moon.  We're going to get rocks, and then what are we going to do with these rocks?  We gotta keep them pristine.  We gotta make sure that they're protected from earth's atmosphere.  And so we didn't start building our lunar receiving lab until much later.  And then it, it's, it was a little fight actually to bring it here to Houston.  And the original design of that facility was very tiny.  We did not envision what eventually became known as the lunar receiving lab.  We thought we would just bring home some lunar rocks and package them and send them out to principal investigators.  And then other people got involved and said, \"Well, we have to be concerned about potential life forms coming back from the moon.\"  And suddenly this small little lab that we had, became this huge 83,000 square feet facility.   John Gruener: Yeah sadly the lunar receiving lab, it was in Building 37.  And then they built Building 31 where the, the lunar rocks are now.  And all sorts of collections.  It's not just about the moon.  We, we have astromaterials from all over the solar system.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: You know, different collections.  And sadly, Building 37 is set to be demolished right now.  Yeah, and that's where, that's where the original lunar receiving lab was.  That's where the quarantine facility was for the first few missions to Apollo.  But it wasn't big enough just to handle all of these rocks that are coming back from the moon.  You know, the, it's, it's surprising.  You, you look at the calendar from you know '69 to '72.  And, and how often we were going to the moon back then.  And you know every one of those trips brought back more rocks.  It's like where are we going to put these things?  So before Building 31 got built, there were safes, you know, like bank safes all over the center holding little sealed containers of moon rocks.  They were scattered all over site.   Host: Wow.  John Gruener: Until we got Building 31.  And that, that lunar curation facility built.  And so you know, it's kind of fun to, to think about how these moon rocks were just scattered all over.  Because we just didn't have that building yet.    Host: Yeah.  So did the, did the geoscientists and just science in general look at the rocks and have questions already about you know knowing what rocks they wanted to bring and what they wanted to study?  Or was it just get the rocks and we will study it later and figure it out?    John Gruener: Well, you know, people have been looking at the moon for centuries, first with our eyes.  And then as these things called telescopes got bigger and bigger you could look at the moon in ever-increasing detail.  And by looking at the surface features, the topography, the terrain on the moon, geoscientists had a pretty good idea, you know, that those dark areas up there on the moon were going to be some type of lava, you know.  Because you look on earth here and it's dark lava, right?  Coming out of Hawaii and other places.  So they had, you know, they had a pretty good idea of the dark areas on the moon.  Weren't quite sure about the bright areas of the moon.  You know, you look up at the, the moon at night.  And you'll see the dark areas and the bright areas.  And here's a great you know time for a public service announcement.  This Saturday is the International Observe the Moon Night.  And, and so there's stuff going on all over the country here in Houston.  At Space Center Houston.  We'll, we'll, we'll have you know something going on with the Lunar Planetary institute and JSC.  But all over the world, there are these events, you know just to look up at that moon at night.  And, and, and say wow, there it is, and we've been there, right?    Host: Oh yeah.    John Gruener: But those bright areas of the moon we weren't so sure about.  And a matter of fact, on Apollo XVI, that was our real own mission.  Only mission that went to those bright areas of the moon.  They train the astronauts to look for these light-colored volcanic rocks called rhyolite.  Right?  So basalt's really dark.  That's stuff coming out of Hawaii.  So you see these dark lava flows.  You have these beautiful black sand beaches.  That result from the breakdown of those volcanic rocks.  Well, they're also, volcanic rocks are higher in silicon.  And they're, they're much lighter in color.  And so they, they train these Apollo XVI astronauts to look for these felsic you know volcanic rocks.  But they also trained them in other types of rocks and minerals.  And when John Young and Charlie Duke landed there, it was like, you know, they didn't quite say, \"Houston, we have a problem.\"  But they said, \"Hey, this isn't exactly that volcanic landscape you told us it was going to be,\" right?  So then we get these rocks back.  And then, and now we can start formulating ideas on how the moon formed and why are these particular rocks and minerals there?  So we had a broad idea of what we might find on the moon.  But clearly, you know, no real understanding of, about those bright areas.    Host: Yeah, that's one of my favorite parts about the Apollo program is just you, they, they had a mission.  And then they did that mission.  And then the next mission was kind of evolving and doing new things, right?  Let's add a car.  Let's take away margin.  Let's pick up more rocks.  It's, it was just fascinating to see that.  And then just dealing with those challenges as they came along.  Because everything was new, so obviously not everything was going to be perfectly planned.  Including, where are you going to put the moon rocks whenever you get them?    John Gruener: And there's even a program called the Apollo Applications Program, of AAP.  And that was if we use the lander stage that brought, brought the astronauts to the surface of the moon.  And we put a little house on it or a habitat.  Right?  Now we could actually stay on the moon for more than a handful of days.  And we could you know start this idea of a lunar base or a lunar outpost.  Where we were up there for months at a time instead of days at a time.  But none of that ever made it to prime time, you know.  We had Apollos XVIII, XVIIII, and XX in, in the plans.  And those didn't make it into it either.    Host: Right, yeah.  No, I, it was a lot of a funding issue.  Jennifer, I know like as it was going along.  Was it the public interest was sort of kind of falling off?  You know, we landed on the moon and that was like yay!  And then they did it again.  It was like, well this is, this is the same thing.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well actually funding started to fall in the mid-sixties under Lyndon Johnson.  We were in the middle of, of fighting the Vietnam War.  We were also fighting a war on poverty.  You know, you couldn't have your guns and butter, like they, they say.  And so you know that, that was part of the issue.  You know, we had had this, this huge budget.  And you actually see it on a graph.  It just sort of declines rather precipitously.  So things had fallen off well before we even landed on the moon or went around the moon.    Host: Yeah.  Now, that was kind of when we started thinking about even missions beyond, too, right?  That's Skylab was sort of let's take this thing that we have and fit it into a space station sort of concept, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely, yeah.  You know, how can we use some of the equipment that we have for Apollo to create a space station?  And so we start looking at that.  We also start looking at like I said, the Space Shuttle in 1969.  Max Faget comes up with this idea for a reusable spacecraft.  Because we, we couldn't really reuse anything from Apollo.  It was all throwaway.  And so, you know, we come up with this new idea.  It's going to be cheaper.  We're going to fly more regularly.  And we start working on those designs in 1969.  We have people who are about, 20 people who are locked in a room here at JSC working on what's it going to look like?  How's it going to operate?    Host: So that was actually, that's actually a huge part of the Apollo program and one of the difficulties looking forward now.  Is we're talking-- John, you mentioned returning to the moon.  And what are we going to do?  A lot of it is dealing with staying there for a long time.  Learning how to work and live.  But the Apollo program, all of these pieces of technology.  The lunar lander, the, the rovers, the command module.  They were meant for just using that one time.  They had limited consumables, right?  So when you're kind of designing that mission.  Taking away that margin like you said, how, how does that work?  How do you?  Was it, everything just built to be thrown away?  How do you justify the lifespan of the technology itself?    John Gruener: Well, we had that schedule, you know.  Send a man to the moon, return him safely before the end of the decade.  So as long as you have a president pushing this.  And then you have a Congress supporting the president pushing this.  And throwing lots of money at it.  You can make things work, brute force, you know, get it there, get it done.  But you're not thinking long-term operations.  You're not thinking sustainable operations.  So Apollo was not sustainable.  But it wasn't meant to be sustainable.  It was meant to beat the Soviet Union to the moon.    Host: Exactly.  Yep, that makes sense.  So now, now we have, we've used the, the technology to get us to the moon.  We used the technology to get those moon rocks back.  What have we been learning?  You know, we have all of this moon rocks.  We built the facility, put them in.  Now we're, we're looking at them.  What is so interesting about the moon?    John Gruener: Well, I wish I could say we've answered all the questions.    Host: I guess that's a good thing, right?  There's still more.    John Gruener: Oh, there's, there's tons of more questions, right?  But we have a better idea of, of maybe how the moon formed.  Before we went to the moon with Apollo, there were three, you know, major theories or hypothesis on how the moon formed.  One was called the fission theory.  Where there, there, the early proto-earth is, is spinning on its axis really fast.  And it's, you know, it'll throw off a blob or two out into space.  Around the equator where it's spinning the fastest.  And those blobs would eventually form this moon, right?  So that was the fission theory.  But the problem with that is the earth is not spinning fast now.  So what happened to all that angular momentum.  If you're spinning so fast to spin off blobs to make the moon.  Why aren't we spinning that fast now?  So we said okay, maybe that doesn't work.  Then there was the idea that the moon and the earth formed in the same neighborhood at the same time.  In the same neighborhood.  And you know, so it's kind of like a binary planetary system, if you will.  Right?  And when the first moon rocks came back, they were very similar to the earth.  It's like, ah, Coaccretion right?  That, that's, that's the thing that actually happened.  The moon and the earth formed together.  But then there were some small difference.  You know, so well, maybe that doesn't quite work either.  And, and how do you get, again, this, this binary system where the moon's orbiting the earth, right?  How do you get all that to work physics wise?  If they form together in the same neighborhood.  So I don't know, still up in the air.  But it, it was more favored than say the fission theory.  And then there was the capture theory.  That the moon formed somewhere else.  You know kind of the same distance from the sun as the earth.  But, but somewhere else.  And then as the earth and the moon came close together.  The gravity of the earth pulled the moon in, right?  It got it into orbit.  So that was the capture theory.  So those are the three main ideas on how the moon formed.  Well, when then rocks came back.  More and more people started thinking about this.  Says you know?  How about this idea?  You know let's just call it the big whack idea where there's a Mars-sized planet out there.  And it slams into the earth in the, you know, early history of the solar system.  And that collision then throws out or ejects you know all sort of particles and mass into orbit around the earth.  Much of it rains down back on earth.  But some of it stays in orbit.  And then all of that debris from that giant impact formed the moon.  And so that's kind of the prevailing theory right now.  This thing called the giant impact theory for the formation of the moon.  And then when you started looking at the actual minerals of the moon.  It's like, wow.  We think the moon, you know, at least the upper surface of the moon was completely molten at one time.  So you know you think of the Star Wars movies, and Mustafar, where they have those great light saber duels.  And it's a very volcanically active planet, right?  Well, we get these, these rocks and minerals back from the moon.  And the best way we can explain them is that there was a magma ocean, if you will.  On the outer hundreds of kilometers of the surface of the moon, right?  And, and as, as the, the lava or magma cooled, the lighter the rocks, the rocks with the lighter elements in it kind of floated towards the top.  The rocks with the heavier elements kind of sunk to the bottom.  And you kind of have some segregation going on there.  And so this magma ocean hypothesis now has come up.  Not only for the moon, but maybe all of the inner, you know, the planets and the moons in the inner solar system.  So the moon's not only teaching us about how the moon formed, but possibly how the inner solar system formed.  All the different planets.   Host: Wow.  John Gruener: And then you look up at the moon.  You know, we're all going to look at the moon this Saturday, right?  International Observe the Moon Night.    Host: I know I will.    John Gruener: And you look up at the moon.  You see those circular dark features.  And those are big flood lavas.  Basaltic lava, like out of Hawaii.  But before that lava was there, there were huge holes in the ground.  So when something hits the moon, it makes a crater.  Everybody kind of familiar with that term, crater.  But when the crater is huge like continent size, we call them basins.  Impact basins.  And so there's a real question is when did all those basins form on the moon?  And did they form all at once, you know, or relatively near in time?  You know, hundreds of millions of years apart?  Or was there kind of a steady formation over the first couple billion years of the moon?  So we have this thing called the cataclysmic bombardment idea.  That all of these big holes on, on the moon were created pretty much at once.  But if it was happening on the moon, it was also happening at the earth, right?  So we're trying to tie in the, the impact ages of the moon.  And the, the life on earth.  And when did life, you know, what are oldest fossils on the earth?   And how do we tie that into the formation ages of the surface of the moon?  And then the big impact basins.  So what we've learned a lot from the moon is that very early beginning of our inner solar system.  And not just for the moon, but for, you know, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Earth.  All, all of that.  So the moon is just a great laboratory to test ideas and hypothesis on planetary formation and then differentiation between crust and mantle and core.  We learn about all that in junior high school science class.  Right?  So we, we've learned a lot about the moon.  But of course, any time you get into an, an experiment in science.  You answer your maybe your primary question.  But all these secondary questions start to pop up.  And because we brought the rocks back.  We could put them in very detailed scientific instruments.  You know, in laboratories.  And measure things down to the parts per million or parts per billion.  And so now we're, we're trying to understand you know why do these rocks have chlorine in them and these rocks don't?  You know?  So you know and, and that gets into, you know, that whole idea of geochemistry and petrology of the moon, you know.  Really, really fine details have been argued now for, for decades.  And maybe you know, to the, to the common person that kind of stuff doesn't really matter.  But it does.  When you're trying to you know take bits and pieces of space debris and put them together to make a planet.  It, it's all important.    Host: Yeah, that's actually one of my favorite things about—I, I have a lot of astromaterials folks on the podcast because I find it fascinating.    John Gruener: It's a fun place to work.    Host: It, it's super fun.  And you can look at a rock and get this fascinating story about molten lava and this fiery world and bombardment.  And all these fantastic stories all from looking at a rock.  And you can get a history.    John Gruener: Yes, as a matter of fact.  So on Apollo XI, they had one suitcase.  And the astronauts were trained to, you know, pick up the rocks with their, with their devices.  Their little tongs or what not.  Shovels and scoops.  And put the, the rocks into bags, right?  And then seal up the bags.  And put the bags into a box.  And then close the box.  And you know Neil was on the surface.  And he, he looked in this box and it was full of rocks.  But as you know, rocks don't pack perfectly.  So there was a lot of void space.  He just used a shovel.  He started piling dirt into the box to fill up the, the void space.  And that sample which is 10084, so we, we number all of our samples that came back from the moon.  And, and 10084 was just that dirt that Neil decided we need to fill up all this empty space in the suitcase to make this trip really worth it.  And some people look at that, that soil sample.  And you, you can describe the, the formation of the moon from that one soil sample.  Right?  All the other rocks and soils help validate what, what, what you could do with 10084.  But yeah, it's amazing what you can do with just a little bit.    Host: Unbelievable.  So I mean, this was one of those things that was completely new, right?  It's like go to the moon and pick up rocks.  And then when you do, you realize how much space is left over.  So you kind of have to pull an audible and say, \"Alright, let's fill that space.\"  Jennifer, I'm sure you've talked to a lot of folks that have actually walked on the moon.  Can you talk about the difficulties of just adjusting to the one-sixth g?  And what they were learning from each other as time went on?  And more and more people started walking on the moon?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, I’m try to think about—We have talked to a number of people who have walked on the moon.  But I don't think any of them have talked about necessarily the difficulty that they encountered.  I think more what they talk about is just the beauty of the moon.  And our place in the, the solar system.  And how in awe they were of, of being on the moon.  And this great accomplishment.  And the opportunity that they had as an astronaut to be in the lunar surface.  And the contributions that they and other people made to the Apollo program.  I think it was just a once in a lifetime opportunity for them.  You know, people like you know Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.  All of those guys, you know.  It's just, it was an amazing opportunity.    John Gruener: And, and Buzz Aldrin, you know, he said this is magnificent desolation.  What a great way to describe that, the lunar surface, right?    Host: Yeah.  John Gruener: Because it is magnificent, but it is desolate.  There's nothing there.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: As, as, as you know, human explorers have gone all over this planet.  But we always encounter other peoples.  Or other animals, right?  Or other plants.  And of course none of that was on the moon.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Do you know what?  We're talking a lot about those, those Apollo missions that went down to the surface of the moon.  Coming up here in a couple months, December will be the 50th anniversary of Apollo VII, VIII, right?    Host: Right, right.    John Gruener: And that photograph that they call earthrise.  So as the space, spacecraft were coming around from the back side of the moon.  You know, now you can start seeing the earth again.  And because of the motion of the spacecraft.  It kind of looked like the earth was rising into the sky, right?  And they scrambled to get their cameras in to take this picture.  And it made the cover of Time magazine.  And, and really, you know, a lot of people credit that photograph of, of the earth from the moon helping start the big environmental movement.  That you know we have a very fragile planet.  We'd better take care of it.  You don't see political boundaries from the moon.   Host: Right.  John Gruener: So you know those experience, those personal experiences that those, those guys had.  Were, were just tremendous.  And it's fun to talk to them about that.  So in the science world, we, we do bring, we did bring those guys back for discussions during the.  About ten years ago, we had the Constellation program.  And we were talking about going back to the moon.  And so the, the engineers who designed the spacesuits.  The scientist who want to do things on the moon.  We had a lot of discussions.  So how did those spacesuits work on Apollo?  And the question, and the answer was not very well.  You know, it kept them alive, but there was no mobility in the waist.  Very hard to walk.  Right?  So it was that lower-body mobility that they're really trying to get into the new suits.  For our return to the moon.  The gloves particularly were very hard to work.  So, so they're working real hard.  Amy Ross and others are working real hard to make nice gloves that you can use more easily.  The problem with spacesuits.  You know, you, you're like the Michelin man, you blow up.  And so you have to basically fight against the spacesuit to make it move.  Whether you want to open your hand.  Open your hand, you're pushing against the glove to open your hand.  You're pulling against the glove to close your hand.  And those, the Apollo astronauts, their hands were just wore out.   Host: Right.  John Gruener: Even the, the three days missions.  You know, Jack Schmitt will say, \"I couldn't have done more.\"  Because after those three days, you are just wore out from fighting your suit.  Trying to do the science that were on the agenda, right?  So, so scientists.  We have guys like Trevor Graff and Kelsey Young, geoscientists working with the suit designers now to try to get suits that work better on the surface of the moon that will allows scientists to bend over, to pick up a rock.  Or, because you, you know, there are blooper reels of these guys falling down.  Host: Right.  John Gruener: All over the moon, right?  And you know, it was mostly when they were trying to bend over to pick something up.  And of course they pop back up.  Because it was, it was easy with the one-six gravity.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  John Gruener: But it is a difficult place to get used to and to work.    Host: So by the end, what, how?  You said they were there for three days.  How long were those spacewalks that made it so tiring?    John Gruener: They're always less than eight hours, you know.  So think about your eight-hour work day.  Host: That’s still three days in a row.  John Gruener: Right, three days in a row, exactly.  So, so nowadays, we talk about future missions to the moon.  We talk about rotating the crews.  Very much like we did on the Space Shuttle.  Where we would have a Hubble Telescope repair mission.  And on one day, two astronauts would go out.  And then on the next day, two different astronauts would go out.  And then on the third day, maybe the same astronauts from the first day would go out so these, this idea of alternating crews.  And give them a day off in between EVAs to rest.  That's kind of what we're talking about with the moon.  And, and, and that's why that, you know, that, those long-term stays start to pay off.  Because if you and I wanted to go to Orlando and go to you know Disney World or Orlando, you know, the Studios there with Harry Potter World, and all that stuff.  We could go there.  You know, it's, most of the money is getting there, right?  And we could spend 30 minutes there, a couple hours there like Apollo XI.  But would we really get our money's worth?  You know, at Disney World if we only went there for 30 minutes to a couple hours?  Right?    Host: Right.  John Gruener: You want to spend the entire day.  You spent all this money and time and energy to get to Disney World.  You want to spend some time there and enjoy the rides.  And it's much the same thing with the moon.  So we know it's a hard environment to work in.  So you know, just use our smarts and, and rotate the crews.  And protect the crews.  You know, that's our number-one job here at JSC is the safety of the crews.   Host: Absolutely.  John Gruener: So we can't give them an impossible task to do on the moon.  But they, those guys in Apollo were, were giants.  I mean, they worked like Hercules out there, what they did on those three-day missions.    Host: Right.  Yeah, they were all mostly, well I think most of them were test pilots except for Jack Schmitt, right?    John Gruener: Scientist, yeah.    Host: Scientist, yeah.  So he was the one.  I'm sure he, you're, he's still very involved in the community, right?    John Gruener: Oh yes, yes.  We're getting ready to have a meeting in just a couple weeks.  Lunar exploration analysis group.  We meet once a year.  And Jack's always there.  And man is, is does he add to the conversation.    Host: Yeah, really well too.  Because you can all talk about the moon.  And he can say, \"Well, when I was there.\"  [Laughter] So he's got that on his side.  So Jennifer, I kind of wanted to end on, on this note.  Well actually first, I have a super-random question that I, it's just-- .    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Is it trivia?    Host: Well, yeah.  Well, it's something that has always been in the back of my mind.  I, I'm thinking about the Apollo XI landing, them actually landing on the moon.  You see Neil Armstrong get out of the lunar module and actually jump out and touch the lunar suit, surface.  How did the camera get there?  Did it shoot out from the lunar module once it landed?  Do you know?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: I'm not 100% sure.    Host: I've always been curious.    John Gruener: Yeah, so they did have externally mounted cameras.  And I'm not sure if it was on one of these little, you know, crisscross things that, that, that kind of telescope out you know.  To, to, you know, flop out one direction.  I'm not exactly sure either.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: How it was done.  I watched it as a kid.  I mean, we talked about the early '60s and, and John Gruener was a little boy growing up here in Houston.  Watching all this stuff.  And so you know, we happened to be in New Orleans when, when Apollo XI happened.  And I always was fascinated with well why can't we see right through these guys?  They're like ghosts.  Those early television images.  If you watch the Apollo XI guy.  You can see through them.  And I never understood that.  I'm not a photography guy.  But that's, we kept asking our parents.  \"Are they really there?  Because you can see right through them.\"    [ Laughter ]    Host: Yeah, those early, early TVs.  Alright, sorry that was a random, random question.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: No, and I hate to be-- .    Host: It's just something as the public affairs guy.  That's the part, stuff that gets to me.  It's just like how did they get that footage?  Where's that, where's that footage coming from?  And like the livestreaming capability.  I was always wondering.    John Gruener: And part of geologic training was to get the astronauts to take pictures of the rocks on the moon.  And up-close pictures, surface of the moon.  Well, Neil Armstrong had that camera on his chest.  Right?  So you see lots of picture of Buzz Aldrin on the moon from Apollo XI.  There are almost no pictures of Neil Armstrong on the moon.  The ones we do have are from those external camera that you talked about when he went down the ladder.  And also there are pictures where you can see Neil as a reflection in Buzz's visor.  They had those gold visors to protect them from the bright sun.  And you can see Neil in that visor.  But he had the camera.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: So my wife always complains about that.  We have all these vacation pictures, and I'm never in them!  [Laughter] So luckily there's things called selfies now, right?    Host: Yes, yes.  Need a selfie stick.  See there's a good Apollo technology.    John Gruener: Neil needed a selfie stick on the moon.    Host: A selfie stick, there you go.  But I do, I do want to end with this note.  Jennifer, you were talking about the astronauts talking about the beauty of the moon.  What were some of the things that really stuck out to you when you were talking with them?  Whether it was the beauty of the moon or the view of earth from the moon?  What were some of the things that stuck out?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, some of the things that, that John was talking about.  Just the fact that, that earth seemed so fragile from where they were, you know?  You couldn't see the boundaries of countries or nations.  It was just one planet.  And you know, they were really struck by this blue marble in a sea of blackness.  It really stood out.  And it was such a unique place compared to other, other places like the moon.  Which was so stark and so desolate.    Host: Right.  John Gruener: And for those Apollo guys on the surface of the moon, they always saw earth, home, up in the sky.  Because all of the missions from Apollo were on the front side of the moon.  We never sent Apollo astronauts to the far side of the moon or the back side of the moon, right?    Host: Yes.  John Gruener: Matter of fact, no real spacecraft has done a mission back there yet.  The later this year, the, the Chinese are getting ready to launch Chang'e-4 and that will be the first spacecraft of any type.  To land on the far side of the moon.    Host: Wow.  John Gruener: So you know, just that, that draw to home.  There's home waiting for us.  Finish our work, and we get to go home, and there it is.  So some people worry about that with Mars.  You know, you go all the way to Mars.  And of course earth is not there in the sky.  It is, but it's teeny-tiny.  It's a little blue dot in the sky right?  But what will those people who work and live on Mars for long periods of time, how will they feel?  Because earth is so far away and they can't see home.  You know?    Host: Yeah, no that's a big thing.  I talked with a lot of folks from the human research program about isolation and confinement.  And what that does, especially for missions where you would be on Mars for a very long time.  And it's, it's real.  So you'd have to have that sort of connection.  Definitely something we need to explore.  And it's, it's an interesting point just to look up and say huh.  That's, that's everyone I know.  You know, everyone I know, everyone I've ever known is on just that little level of circle.  It's got to be just a profound feeling.  And I hope something that more people get to, get to talk about in the future, too.  Whenever we're talking about these upcoming lunar missions.  Just to see, get that perspective once again.  It's going to be fantastic.    John Gruener: Right, because it's not just NASA or the other space agencies like China.  We're starting to get commercial industry involved as well.  And commercial companies are now, you know, working on delivering things to the moon, including people.  So the hope and dream is that the commercial companies can not only take NASA astronauts to the moon, but they can take citizens to the moon as well.  To experience it.    Host: Yeah, for all mankind.  I love it.  [Laughter] Or humankind.  There you go.  Alright, so John and Jennifer, thank you so much for coming on!  This was, this was better than I expected, honestly.  Because I, I was kind of, I was kind of thinking like how are we going to combine the history and the science?  But I, I think it worked, and I really appreciate your time today.    John Gruener: Sure, it was fun.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Thanks for inviting us.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal.  And Mr. John Gruener about Apollo and the moon.  We went into the history and explored some of the science and how this is all going to help us here in the future.  So like I said, in the intro, we are in the middle of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo program and the missions that coincide with that.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 27, The Search for Life.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So this is the podcast where we bring in the experts -- NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts -- all to tell you the coolest information about NASA and about space.  So today we're talking about something super cool, how we're looking for life in the universe.  We're talking with Aaron Burton and Marc Fries.  Aaron and Marc are both planetary scientists here at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.  And we had a great discussion about the different NASA initiatives all looking at organic material in the solar system and what we're finding from these studies that help us understand the fundamentals of life here on Earth and possibly in the universe.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right into our talk with Dr. Aaron Burton and Dr. Marc Fries.  Enjoy.    [00:00:50] [ Music ]    [00:00:57] >> T minus five seconds and counting.  Mark.    [00:01:05] >> [Inaudible] there she goes.    [00:01:06] >> Houston, we have a podcast.    [00:01:08] [ Music ]    [00:01:14] >> Well, this one's going to be good because -- I'm excited because this one's about the ultimate question, right?  Are we alone in the universe?  That's literally -- I mean, it's in the NASA mission statement, right?  Everything we do is to explore the unknown and -- reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind or something like that.  So I guest I'll start off with this question: How many times a day do you ask yourself that question, \"Are we alone?\"    [00:01:40] [ Laughter ]    [00:01:42] >> Well, it's back there, you know, squirrel caging around somewhere all the time.    [00:01:46] >> Yeah.    [00:01:46] >> I don't know if I stop in, like, the middle of shaving and go, \"Wait a minute, but are we alone?\"    [00:01:51] [ Laughter ]  But, you know, I do think about it on a regular basis, sure.    [00:01:54] >> I figure, well, because that's the whole thing, right?  This is your job.  Your job is to look for organic material, right?  So I guess to just pull back.  And I just think that would be super cool, are we alone or -- you know, that's not bad.    [00:02:06] >> You know, I'd say I think about it more at night.  Well, when you look up at the stars and you just see all of the stars.    [00:02:13] >> Okay.    [00:02:13] >> That's just what we can see.    [00:02:15] >> Yeah, exactly.    [00:02:16] >> So the thought that we're the only game in town seems a pretty -- pretty unlikely.    [00:02:21] >> Yeah.  I just took a camping trip out to Big Bend a couple weeks ago.  And that was just an eye-opener.  Because I thought I had seen, \"Wow, there's a lot of stars in the sky,\" you know, when I was living in Pennsylvania.  But out in Big Bend you can see the Milky Way.  And there's constellations where you couldn't even see them because there was just that many more stars.  It was just the clearest sky I've ever seen in my life.  I was like, \"Wow, this is just -- from a different part of Earth I can see this many stars.\"  It was crazy.  All right.  Well, so let's start off with just a little bit about you guys and since you're both planetary scientists kind of what your focuses are.    [00:02:59] >> Okay.  Yeah.  So I have built a research lab where we look for organic molecules that we find in meteorites.  So these are carbon-containing molecules.  And I'm interested in the ones that are related to biology.  So things that biology could use.  And so by looking at the organic molecules that are found in meteorites, that gives us a way to look at samples where biologically interesting molecules are made but they weren't made by life.  They were just made by sort of abiotic chemistry, things that can happen in our solar system.  And so I'm interested in doing that because I want to know about the chemistry that was going on before life started.  And then from understanding that chemistry, try and take the next step forward to think of if we know the chemistry that was going on without life, how did that transition into a living system that we have?    [00:03:53] >> Wow.  Literally the origins of life.    [00:03:56] >> Yeah.    [00:03:56] >> That's pretty cool.  How about you, Marc?    [00:03:59] >> I work in curation.  I'm a scientist in curation.  And then curation I should explain.  We basically take care of NASA's collections.  We have the Apollo moon rock collection, we have meteorites from Antarctica, we have samples from -- delivered by a couple sample return missions.  And all the curators, all the curation scientists are expected to have a scientific interest as well and maintain a scientific course of study.  What I study is carbon in geological systems, not necessarily just organic chemistry.  Aaron's much more of a specialist in that, much more of an expert in that than I am, per se.  But more of carbon in entire systems ranging from, you know, gas phase carbon that you find in rocks, whether it's biological or geological carbon is part of a system on planetary surfaces and interiors and such.    [00:04:54] >> But it's fair to say, you know, carbon is an essential component of life, right?    [00:05:00] >> As far as we know, yes.    [00:05:01] [ Laughter ]    [00:05:02] >> That's true.  There's a bunch of other things, you know, that we can talk about.  I don't know -- I don't know if you guys actually discuss silicon-based life forms or anything like that or --    [00:05:12] >> Yeah, I --    [00:05:12] >> -- I would say carbon.  Carbon's usually the good stuff, right?  That's the basic form of life.    [00:05:18] >> Yeah.  So at the most simple aspect you have carbon, and we like it because it make four bonds.  So you can make these long polymers out of it.  And so if you just go down the periodic table, silicon, well, that does, you know, similar things.    [00:05:31] >> Right.    [00:05:32] >> But carbon's actually pretty special.  So if you compare carbon and silane or methane and silane -- so metaion is CH4, silane is SIH4.  You know, those would be sort of the analogous molecules.  By silane actually is, like, an incredibly explosive gas.  And it's very difficult to keep on Earth, whereas methane, you know, sort of hangs around and gets produced.  So that works out well for organisms that produce methane and for life.  And then if you start looking at other things like CO2 as a gas, that's what we breathe in and breathe out, you know, trees use that for photosynthesis.  If you compare that SIO2, you know, that's --    [00:06:14] >> It's a rock.    [00:06:15] >> [Laughs] Yeah, that's a --    [00:06:15] >> Kind of hard to breathe rock.    [00:06:17] >> [Laughs] Yeah, it's -- yeah.  So it's hard to breathe.  It's not very easy for organisms to process it or to access it.  And so, you know, it ends up being just a less mobile sort of building block.  If you're whole life was centered around silicon, now it's all sand, right?    [00:06:34] >> Yeah, a little harder.  So carbon is just the magic ingredient, really, just because that ability to bond to so many things.    [00:06:43] >> Yeah, at least based on physics in our solar system.    [00:06:48] >> Well, so, you know, the whole just concept of life, searching for life, right?  I mean, there's a lot of things that we study out in the universe, but this quest to find life outside the solar system, why is that so fundamental to us as humans, to go out and to search for it?    [00:07:06] >> It's a good question, kind of hard to answer because it's just kind of -- best answer I could give is that it's just a fundamental question.  I mean, anybody's who's looked up at night, like Aaron said, has had to wonder.  You know, there's an awful lot of stuff up there.  Surely there's got to be something else.  It's just a basic, almost primal human query.  I don't know how to put it any better than that, honestly.    [00:07:34] >> Yeah.    [00:07:35] >> Yeah.  I mean, I think it's kind of like the human tradition of exploring.  And, you know, first it started out, you know, humans on a land mass.  And they said, \"Well, what's on the other side?  You know?  What's over those mountains?\"    [00:07:46] >> Right.    [00:07:47] >> What's across that river?  And then expanded to what's across that ocean?  And then what's at the bottom of the sea floor?  And now, you know, what's on the next world over?  And, you know, it's kind of that exploring but also then, you know, if we're asking these questions, is there anyone else out there that's asking those same questions?    [00:08:06] >> Yeah.  That's true.  I mean, if you think about human history, just the fact that people travel, they find a new civilization and can open up new trade routes.  Or even as far as cross the Atlantic Ocean and discover a whole new world trying to find more trade routes or something like that.  So it's just -- I guess you're right, it's kind of built into our DNA that we just have this drive to -- it's not enough, right?  We want to -- we want to know.  We want to know why.  We want to know more.    [00:08:33] >> Yeah.  You look at the sky and you say, \"I'm pretty sure there's life out there.  but I want to sort of prove it.\"  You know?    [00:08:37] >> Yeah.    [00:08:38] >> I want to find it, actually know.    [00:08:40] >> Pretty sure is not good enough [Laughs].    [00:08:42] >> Luckily humans have a low fascination threshold.    [00:08:46] [ Laughter ]    [00:08:48] >> So -- so I mean, just besides the fascinating of it, why is it important to understand the origins of life?  You know, what can we get out of it?    [00:08:59] >> Well, for me, you know, I've just been interested, I guess, from the scientific standpoint of, you know, how does life start?  Which I think naturally leads to could life exist elsewhere?  And so those are two kind of the basic questions.  Because if life could exist elsewhere, then that answers your sort of fundamental, intrinsic question of is there life elsewhere?  If you know how it started, then you know what signs to look for, what kinds of environments you need to look in, what types of chemistry needs to be going on for you to look there for life.    [00:09:34] >> So how does just -- you know, once you do that, you know, I guess you can help you search for life outside, but what about here on Earth?  You know?  Is there applications for, you know, learning more about how the origins of life and how that comes to be?  How can that help us here?    [00:09:51] >> See, I would answer that by saying that, you know, fundamentally we're answering -- it's like we said, like [inaudible] talked about just a minute ago, this understanding the origin of life is one of primal fundamental human queries that most people want to know.  And as scientists, our goal, our purpose is to discover exactly that sort of thing, to try to answer those sort of questions, to be the interpreters of the world around us, to try to enrich everyone's lives.  And that's a really important thing that a lot of people are interested in.  So it's a high priority for scientific investigation.  For a more nuts and bolts approach, you know, maybe understanding the fundamentals of how life arose would give us better understanding into our own biochemistry at a very fundamental level.  That's a possibility.    [00:10:49] >> Improving life for us, you know, making life better for humans.  Just however -- you know, bring it into industry, make better drugs or understand how, you know, people grow up or develop.  You know, just life, right?    [00:11:03] >> The fundaments of how a cell functions on the chemical level.  It can't be bad to know more about that.    [00:11:11] >> [Laughs] Well, talking to --    [00:11:13] >> I would --    [00:11:13] >> Oh, go ahead.    [00:11:14] >> Sorry.  So I would just add that a lot of what origins of life researchers try to do is sort of recreate how life could have started.  You know, ideally if you had a time machine, you would just go back in time 4.5 billion years --    [00:11:28] >> Oh, that would be easy [Laughs].    [00:11:29] >> -- to the start of life.  But it raises a philosophical issue, which is what if you disrupted that process and so you actually killed life?  So maybe that's a bad idea.  But, you know, without a time machine we don't have to worry about that.  But the best we can hope to do is sort of recreate how life started or how life could have started.  And so a lot of the experiments that have gone on in there have looked at sort of alternatives to DNA.  And so these alternatives to DNA have actually been shown to not be recognized by sort of modern biology.  So you can make sort of a drug out of this alternative DNA that now has a longer lifespan inside of a human.  You know?  So it's kind of expanded the range of drugs that are accessible and kind of opened up or helped contribute to the field of synthetic biology where we can start, you know, doing gene manipulation, genetic therapies.  So there really are practical applications of it in addition to satisfying our kind of curiosity about how life started.    [00:12:32] >> Just out of curiosity, these studies, are there any going on, on the International Space Station right now that have to do with sort of understanding life and how the origins or maybe just how it affects humans?    [00:12:44] >> Well, yeah, every astronaut that we send up there is sort of an experiment on how --    [00:12:48] >> There you go.    [00:12:49] >> -- how environmental conditions are affecting life and biology.  But there's also exposures.  So they put microorganisms on the outside of the ISS, for example, and then expose them to radiation, that sort of thing, bring the organisms back.  So that's kind of, you know, an emerging field, too.    [00:13:10] >> Wow.  All right.  So we talked a lot about the why of -- why search for life and all of that.  But let's pull back and just kind of understand just what we're talking about here.  So how -- as one of the experts in the field of understanding life and studying life, how would you define life, Aaron?    [00:13:28] >> That's a good question [Laughs] that people have actually really wrestled with.    [00:13:33] >> Really?    [00:13:33] >> It's not an easy one to answer.  So the origins of life community has settled on a sort of mouthful, which is that life is a self-sustaining chemical system that is capable of Darwinian evolution.  And so, you know, there's a lot in there.    [00:13:52] >> Yeah, yeah.  That makes sense.    [00:13:53] >> But self-sustaining means something that can actually reproduce itself and grow, not necessarily grow in size but grow in population.  So if you have one molecule and now it can make, you know, ten more, etc. and continue to reproduce.  But it's also important that it be able to actually change over time.  And that's where the Darwinian evolution comes in.  So if you have, you know, a salt crystal that's made up of sodium and chloride, and you can add more sodium and chloride to that salt crystal and it's getting bigger, so it's growing in some sense.  There are more sodiums and chlorides in there.  But it doesn't really change.  Right?  So we would never call a salt crystal alive, even though it can, you know, grow.  It's a chemical system.  So you really need that capacity to change for an organism to be able to do something different and to sort of respond to its environment.  That's a very technical --    [00:14:43] >> It makes sense, right?  You got to check those boxes.  Because otherwise if you do the wrong definition, you know, salt is life now.  So [Laughs].    [00:14:46] >> Yeah.    [00:14:46] >> You'll get that salt life sticker on the back of your car.    [00:14:48] [ Laughter ]    [00:15:00] >> Yeah.    [00:15:01] [ Laughter ]    [00:15:02] >> Totally different thing.    [00:15:03] >> Very funny.  Yeah.    [00:15:04] [ Laughter ]    [00:15:05] >> That's awesome.    [00:15:05] >> So then for you, Marc, I guess you're studying carbon specifically, right?  So then how does that fit into the picture of understanding life?    [00:15:15] >> It kind of goes to what Aaron was saying about understanding the chemical conditions at the origin of life.  There's a fun conundrum there, actually, in that okay, we know that life arose on Earth and -- but it's basically being able to get directly at the conditions where that happened is very, very difficult because of ironically life itself.  Life has basically overprinted everything on the planet.  Whatever conditions it was that gave rise to life on Earth, you know, they might be here today, there might be something in the deep ocean, there's all manner of hypotheses about this, but it's very, very difficult to pin that down because life has altered this planet so -- so completely.  I mean, from the mantle to the surface, to the top of the atmosphere, chemically, morphologically, isotopically, everything has been changed.  And so trying to get back at that original set of conditions that gave rise to life is actually really difficult here on Earth.    [00:16:16] >> Wow.  Is it -- is it, you know, postulated more that life itself started on Earth and then just sort of spread and literally changed the makeup of the Earth, or is there some chance that maybe, you know, it came from somewhere else and maybe just got delivered to Earth or something?    [00:16:34] >> I don't like that --    [00:16:36] [ Laughter ]  Here's the reason I don't like that, is the notion of life coming from somewhere else.  Just from the sake of samples that it doesn't actually answer the question of how life arose; you just moved it somewhere else and put an almost impossible journey in between the origin and its evolution on Earth.  We know that the Earth has been changed considerably by life.  We have oxygen in our atmosphere because of it.  I guess that's off on a tangent a bit.    [00:17:07] >> Please go if you need to.    [00:17:09] [ Laughter ]    [00:17:12] >> Yeah.  So fundamentally that's my problem with saying that it started somewhere else and came here.  Because that you are introducing a big complication to it without really putting any light on how it happened.    [00:17:25] >> Yeah.    [00:17:26] >> Yeah.  As Marc was saying, you know, we think life started in water on a rocky body somewhere.  So whether that's Earth, or Mars, or, you know, somewhere else, you still need life to start on a rocky body with water somewhere.  So, you know, speculating that it was Mars and then it got transported here doesn't -- from a practical standpoint doesn't help you address, you know, those conditions necessarily any better.    [00:17:54] >> Well, still, I mean, narrowing it down to, you know, we could say you need a rocky body with water for it to at least start, right; is that at least a starting point for understanding the origins life?    [00:18:06] >> I think it is.  That's a good distillation.  There's another interesting little conundrum in there.  Aaron mentioned Mars.  And I was just talking about how Earth has been completely overprinted.  There's a lot of interest in trying to find life on Mars.  And that's fine, that's good.  But there's kind of a -- a hidden value to a completely dead Mars.  Let me go off on a little bit of a tangent here.    [00:18:39] >> Please do.    [00:18:40] >> Let's say that life started on Earth and that Mars, even though it had all the conditions for life -- apparently water, fairly warm, fairly dense atmosphere -- never had life.  If that's the case, then basically Mars has preserved in a kind of mummified state those conditions early in the formation of the terrestrial planets when life arose on Earth.  So one of the fun conundrums here is that a completely dead Mars with no history of life may give us -- may be a very powerful tool to understanding the origin of life on Earth.    [00:19:15] >> Huh.  So that's where the many rovers that we've sent to Mars over the year come into play, right?  We're studying Mars and trying to understand its history to see what we can learn about its past and see if what you're saying is true.  Maybe -- maybe the atmosphere was -- was thicker.  Maybe there was water.  And all of these instruments that we're sending there are the things that are finding all of this out.    [00:19:39] >> That's right.  Narrowing down that history.    [00:19:41] >> Yeah.    [00:19:42] >> And looking -- and trying to answer the question of whether there is or was life on Mars.  That's an important part of it.    [00:19:48] >> All right.  Well, understanding Mars and the different, you know, rovers we've sent there to study that -- you said you were part of the curation facility.    [00:19:56] >> Yes.    [00:19:56] >> So -- and you said all the different things that are there, right?  So you're talking about meteorites and moon rocks.  Are there hints there that maybe can points towards the origin of life?    [00:20:07] >> Right.  So amongst the samples we have are samples of Mars.  You know, they come to us as meteorites.  The -- here at NASA we curate -- we partner with the Smithsonian to curate the Antarctic meteorite collection.  We have a very large number of meteorites from Antarctica.  There is a team called ANSMET, the Antarctic Search for Meteorites, which goes every year and collects more of them.  Actually, the team for that left into the field to go start their annual search -- I believe it was two days ago.  They just started off.    [00:20:40] >> All right.    [00:20:40] >> So we get these meteorites every year.  And they include periodically Martian meteorites.  To date, you know, not just the NASA collection, but all the collections in the world, we have on the order of -- well, in excess of a quarter of a metric ton of Mars meteorites.  We have samples of Mars that date back to billions of years old or as young as ten of millions of years old.  We have samples that have come from evidently only a meter deep to ten meters deep or so, others that were solidified in place like a kilometer deep, much deeper than that.  There's this random sampling from all over the planet.  Here's where I say the thing that a lot of people don't like to hear and that I am fairly -- there's a wide range of opinion about -- in the scientific community onto whether or not there's been life on Mars, is life on Mars?  I'm fairly convinced by the meteorite evidence that there is not life on Mars, nor has there been.   [00:21:45] Because in all those meteorites that we have from all over the surface, all manner of depth, all through a wide range of history is this neat random sampling all over the planet, we have yet to see any evidence -- any conclusive evidence of any metabolizing in those rocks.  And that tell us that not just today but for a very long period through the past that these meteorites have witnessed that nothing has lived in them.  I think that that's a fairly compelling result.  It's not the final say, but yeah.    [00:22:19] >> Yeah.  Guys, it's kind of interesting because you say Martian meteorites.  But, you know, to an average Joe like me, I would ask the question how does -- how does a piece of Mars get delivered to Earth?    [00:22:33] >> Right.  Well, the solar system's a wild, unruly place with a lot of things that run into each other.  You know, basically take a look at Mars and you see impact craters all over it.  What happens is a meteorite falls onto Mars, or the moon, or other asteroids and they spall material off in an energetic high-speed event known as an impact and kick material clean off the planet basically.  And this stuff, you know, winds up in orbits across the Earth's orbit and fall to Earth.  And we find them -- they fall -- meteorites fall all the time.  The reason why these guys, ANSMET, goes to Antarctica is because they tend to concentrate in places where they're easier to find there.  There are literally places in the Antarctic ice sheet where the only rock you'll see is something that fell there.  And so they can go out and collect these things there.  And that's the process.  There's an impact at the beginning, a long period in the vacuum of space, a fall to Earth through a fireball which destroys most of the meteorite.   [00:23:40] And if anything survives, it winds up here.    [00:23:43] >> All right.  So, Aaron, what would you be -- do you investigate the meteorites?  Are you looking at organic compounds in them?    [00:23:54] >> Yeah.    [00:23:54] >> So what inside of them would sort of hint at life, that life would exist within that and you can find traces of it?    [00:24:03] >> So I actually usually look at it from the other perspective.  So to me, you know, I look at meteorites, which are the surviving remnants of likely asteroids but potentially even comets.  You know, it's the material that falls to Earth.  So I look at that material and I start with the hypothesis that there was no biology.  So this to me is a dead rock from something that, you know, was an uninhabitable environment.  And then I'm looking at it for the chemistry that can go on without life present.  And so for me, this is, like, the next-best alternative to my time machine from earlier because now I have this asteroid that's been, you know, floating around.  It was formed about at the same time that the Earth was forming in the solar system, so 4.5 billion years ago.  And it's just been floating around in space.  And every now and then pieces of these asteroids get fragmented off and they make their way into Earth.   [00:25:05] And then we get these samples.  And then when I look at one of these samples in this 4.5 billion-year-old rock and I find things like amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins, you know, then I say, \"Okay, so what was the chemistry that was going on in this asteroid or in the solar system 4.5 billion years ago that led me to find the amino acid glycine?\"  That's kind of the perspective.  And we know from sort of modern biology there's DNA, RNA, and proteins.  And in proteins in particular there's 20 amino acids that are used in all of biology.  And if you look at a particularly amino acid-rich meteorite like the Murchison meteorite, which is probably one of the most famous carbon-rich meteorites, so it's got about 80 different amino acids in them.    [00:25:58] >> Whoa.    [00:25:58] >> And many of them are not used in biology at all.  And so, you know, that's both a good indicator that's it's not contamination from modern biology on it, but it's also indicative of sort of abiotic chemistry, you know, happening 4.5 billion years ago where there's a lot more random chemical reactions that are taking place.  Whereas in biology everything is very controlled.  You know, you take a range of chemicals in that you eat, and then you turn them into a fixed number of chemicals that, you know, make up your body.    [00:26:34] >> Yeah.    [00:26:35] >> Whereas abiotic chemistry will make all sorts of things, a whole range of things.    [00:26:40] >> Wow.  So what does that mean?  That means that, you know, life here has restrictions based on what could be possible.  And then maybe there's amino acids that could create life maybe on another planet with a different set of amino acids that are not restricted by the norms of Earth; is that kind of fair?    [00:27:04] >> Yeah.    [00:27:05] >> All right.  I could be a scientist [Laughs].  Maybe not, too fast.  Okay.    [00:27:10] >> Yeah.  So there's two sort of variations on that.  And both of them would sort of be the ideal case -- or you can't have two ideal cases, can you?  But both would be two very good cases.  So one is that you're looking for life on another body, and you find life, and it uses entirely different amino acids.  But it's got proteins, and they're just different than what we have on Earth.  You can say, \"Okay, cool.  You know, that's life and it's not something that we just brought in our spacecraft.\"    [00:27:41] >> Yeah.    [00:27:41] >> The other difference that could happen is subtler.  And it's -- and it's an interesting thing.  So we talked about carbon being able to make four bonds.  And carbon makes sort of a tetrahedron shape when it's in these -- when it's made four bonds.  And so it's almost like a pyramid.    [00:28:01] >> Oh, okay.    [00:28:02] >> And so what's interesting is that the four atoms connected to that carbon atom, if they're arranged in a different way stereochemically or so, like, the different sides of the pyramid and then one point sort of floating up above it, you can actually have two different sort of chiralities or stereochemistries of those molecules.  So we talk about it shorthand left-handed and right-handed molecules, which are really just an easier way for us to keep track of it.  Your two hands are the same, they do the same job.  You know, one's just a left hand and the other's a right hand.  And you don't notice a problem until you grab the wrong glove and it no longer fits on your hand.    [00:28:44] >> Okay.  So it's more of a fitting problem rather than a dominant hand kind of a problem?    [00:28:48] >> Yeah.    [00:28:48] >> It's more of a -- okay -- how things put together.    [00:28:50] >> Yeah.  And then, you know, when you measure the chemical and physical properties of molecules that are handed, they're identical except in how they interact with other handed molecules or certain kinds of light.  And so if you found life on another planet that didn't use different amino acids, it would be interesting if it used a different handedness than life on Earth.  So all life on Earth makes left-handed proteins.  And all life on Earth --    [00:29:18] >> All?    [00:29:19] >> All.    [00:29:19] >> What -- wow.  Okay.    [00:29:21] >> So all life on Earth uses left-handed amino acids in its proteins and all life on Earth uses right-handed sugars in its DNA and RNA.  And so if you were looking for life elsewhere and you found only right-handed proteins and, say, only left-handed sugars, then, hey, you've got life and it's definitely not Earth life.  So it's definitely a difference.    [00:29:43] >> Yeah.  So -- so DNA, RNA is a right-handed sugar that just happens to pair nicely with the left-handed amino acids, which are exclusive to Earth, right?    [00:29:54] >> Yeah, to biology.    [00:29:55] >> To biology?  Okay.  So then would -- is there a left-handed sugar of DNA, RNA, or are you thinking there's something entirely different, like, that would fit with the right-handed amino acid?  Maybe I'm not asking the question right.    [00:30:10] >> No, it's --    [00:30:11] >> It would still be DNA, RNA?    [00:30:14] >> Yeah.  So they're -- you know, so DNA is deoxyribose nucleic acid and RNA is ribonucleic acid.    [00:30:20] >> Right, right.    [00:30:21] >> And what we leave out of there is a little prefix at the front that has a D. And in the case of amino acids and proteins, we leave out a little symbol in front that's an L. And so it's believed that one of those came first and was fixed.  So you either had left-handed proteins or right-handed sugars that came about.  And then proteins or -- the other one evolved around it.  So you started with a system that had left-handed proteins and that fit really well with right-handed sugars.  And that was where evolution took off and that was how you got, you know, sort of left-handed life and right-hand sugars.    [00:31:00] >> I see.  Okay.    [00:31:01] >> But we were talking about synthetic biology and origins of life experiments.  So I have left-handed proteins and right-handed sugars in me.  And if you give me a drug that's made out of left-handed sugars, my left-handed proteins don't recognize those sugars anymore.  And so those molecules can stick around a lot of longer in my body because my natural mechanisms for processing, you know, DNA from food I eat or, you know, bacteria that are floating around everywhere, they don't work on those molecules.    [00:31:31] >> Hmm.  So what's an example of a left-handed sugar that would just sort of stick around?    [00:31:38] >> So you could actually make just left-handed DNA.    [00:31:41] >> Oh.    [00:31:41] >> And left-handed RNA.    [00:31:43] >> How do you make it [Laughs]?    [00:31:45] >> So that's a synthetic organic chemistry that ends up being fairly difficult.  But what's interesting about this is so people have gone in the lab and taken a naturally-occurring left-handed protein and they've synthesized a right-handed version of it.    [00:32:01] >> Yeah.    [00:32:02] >> And they've found that it works just fine.  You know, it fold into its active state.  There's no difference in the activity, except that now this right-handed protein recognizes a left-handed sugar molecule.  So in this case I think it was the glucose molecule.    [00:32:16] >> Okay.    [00:32:16] >> So we eat right-handed glucose all the time -- that's what our natural food is -- but this artificial enzyme that they made wouldn't recognize that.  But when they gave it left-handed glucose, it processed its chemical reaction just fine.    [00:32:32] >> Hmm.  So then -- all right, let's think about a hypothetical.  So if you're on another planet that isn't the mirror world, I guess, right, you got right-handed proteins and you got left-handed sugars, would it kind of look -- it's like a mirror version of Earth, right?  It's just, like, the same.  Would that work, or are we talking about something that would be entirely -- like, things would just look different, act different, or is it just a mirror image?    [00:33:01] >> It would be weight loss world.    [00:33:03] >> Weight loss world.    [00:33:04] >> You go there and eat all you want.  You don't actually -- you're not actually able to metabolize any of the food [Laughs].  Correct me if I'm wrong but, you know, there's no reason why that sort of biology wouldn't work within its own system.  But, you know, if we went there and tried to live there and eat the foot off the tree or whatever, we wouldn't get anything out of it.  If I'm not mistaken, there is a commercially available artificial sweetener that is the other-handed version of sugar and it tastes sweet, but you can't digest it.    [00:33:34] >> Huh.  So what does it do?  Does it make you -- it's not weight loss city in that world, is it?  Or is it because you're not processing it, maybe you don't gain any weight.  I don't know how that would work.    [00:33:46] >> You can't use it.    [00:33:46] >> You can't use it?    [00:33:47] >> Yeah.  It's just -- yeah.    [00:33:48] >> So would you pass it, then?  It will be -- okay.  So it wouldn't just, like, stick around and be fat.  Okay, that's good to know [Laughs].  All right.  Maybe I'll sprinkle that on some cupcakes or something and tell myself it's okay.    [00:34:05] >> Yeah.    [00:34:05] >> [Laughs] So that's interesting, just the idea of right-handedness and left-handedness.  And there's a certain set of amino acids that exist on Earth, but there's a whole realm of possibilities that can exist just because we've studied, you know, rocks in space or something.  So correct me if I'm wrong here because this is just piece of trivia that I thought I knew, but now that you guys are here, I want to ask you.  It's an asteroid when it's in space, it's a meteor when it's passing through the atmosphere, and a meteorite once it hits the ground?    [00:34:38] >> Or a meteoroid in space, which is --    [00:34:40] >> Meteoroid.    [00:34:41] >> Smaller asteroid.    [00:34:42] >> Oh, okay.    [00:34:43] >> But yes, meteor when it's passing through the atmosphere, that's the luminous ball.  And then if anything survives to the ground, that's a meteorite.    [00:34:50] >> Okay.  Yeah, that's always something that stuck in my mind just because, you know, I used to call it the wrong thing.  So when you study meteorites, you are specifically talking about the things that are on the ground?    [00:35:01] >> That's right.    [00:35:01] >> You're not going out and grabbing things and bringing them back or you're not catching things as they're passing through the atmosphere?  You're going out.  And Antarctica's a good place to find them because black rocks on a white surface are pretty good, right?    [00:35:12] >> Yep.    [00:35:12] >> Is it fair to say meteors are falling throughout atmosphere all the time?    [00:35:16] >> All the time.    [00:35:16] >> Yeah.    [00:35:17] >> On average there is a meteorite fall somewhere on Earth about once a day.    [00:35:21] >> Wow.    [00:35:22] >> But, you know, most of those are very small.  You figure 70% of them are going to land in the ocean because planet's about 70% ocean.  You know, of the remainder -- of the remaining 30% half of them are going to happen during the day and probably no one will notice them.  Most of the ones that make it down of the remainder from that -- excuse me -- fall someplace that's, you know, difficult to recover.  And it doesn't take much.  You know, tall grass is enough and you won't find them.  Swamp is enough, you won't them.  If it lands on the nuclear power plant, you're not going to get those back, either.    [00:35:56] [ Laughter ]    [00:35:58] >> On -- so on average you get about a meteorite fall a day somewhere on Earth.  There's the Meteoritical Society maintains a database of all the world's meteorites.  And they record give or take about a dozen new meteorite falls per year.  Those are the ones that are actually found.  Some of those hit something and, you know, they become hard to miss, like, coming through the roof of someone's house or dentist office.  Or other ones are just very large events that people go hunting for and find.  So there's your statistics.    [00:36:32] >> Yeah.  And a lot of the material that comes in is just dust.  By the time it makes it through.  And so if you think about, like, meteor showers that we have all the time, that's when Earth is passing throughout debris from the tail of a comet.  So this shooting star is material that's burning up, you know?  But some of that material falls in as dust.  And so you would never, you know, notice it.    [00:36:52] >> Yeah.    [00:36:53] >> But there's little grains of cosmic dust that are --    [00:36:55] >> Yeah.  We actually have a collection of that, too.  The cosmic dust collection.    [00:37:00] >> How do you collect cosmic dust?    [00:37:01] >> Airplanes -- very, very high altitude.  NASA has a -- operates a fleet of basically former spy planes -- WB-57's here at Ellington and ER-2, which is sort of like a U2, out at Dryden, California.  And they fly to 60,000 feet and up and deploy collectors that collect this falling dust out of the atmosphere.    [00:37:24] >> Wow.  So if it's not big enough to actually strike the Earth, you say it kind of disintegrates and doesn't hit the Earth, but it's there.  It's in the atmosphere just kind of floating around at 60,000 feet.  That's cool.  All right.  I like to see that collection.  That would be a pretty cool collection.  Cosmic dust.    [00:37:38] >> We can do that.    [00:37:40] >> [Laughs] So once it passes through the atmosphere, is there -- is there a change that happens?  Like, is there a difference with if you were to pick up a meteorite off the grouped, maybe there's something that -- the way it interacted with the Earth's atmosphere or something that changed something that would be different from if you were to find the same thing up in space.    [00:37:58] >> Yes.    [00:37:59] >> Okay.    [00:37:59] >> The most fundamental change is that a good probably 99% of it is now gone; it turned into a plasma on the way to the ground.  So most of it's lost.  The next big thing that happens is the outside of any meteorite you find is going to be covered with a molten crust.  I think it's called a fusion crust.  And it kind of looks like a pottery glaze.  It's from basically flash melting the surface of the thing as it's coming through the atmosphere.  And but the -- probably the biggest change that happens to any of them, you know, rule number one of meteorites is that they all have life.  And they get the life from Earth.  When they land here, they're coming into our biosphere.  They will land on the ground somewhere.  Even ones in Antarctica, we've found life in some -- terrestrial, excuse me -- life in a lot of these meteorites.  So that's the biggest change.  Because anything infecting these rocks tends to start to eat any of the carbon that's in there and process it and change the -- like he was saying, it takes the native amino acids and starts to process them into -- as you're basically turning it into microbial matter, now it has a chiral preference as the microbes grow.   [00:39:14] They change it isotopically and chemically over time, and that's probably the single-biggest change that happens.  Especially for organic chemistry and the things we're looking for, for the question of origin of life and whatnot.    [00:39:29] >> Yeah.  So then how do you isolate to find out what things have not been affected and what things you can tell are within the meteorite that, you know, were there before it came to Earth and was affected by Earth's atmosphere?    [00:39:45] >> Exactly the kind of chemical signals that Aaron was just talking about -- chirality, you know, the amino acid abundance, you know, looking for biomarkers/biosignatures, depending on what you want to call them, such as DNA.  If you find terrestrial DNA and terrestrial microbes in this thing, then it's been altered.  You can kind of expect that.  But good laboratory practice is, you know -- is fundamental to sorting out exactly that question.  You know, you have your blanks, and standards, and replicate measurements, and statistical analyses.    [00:40:20] >> And yeah, what I'm looking for molecules that are relevant to biology, I start with the assumption that anything that looks like biology in the sample is from biology that was introduced on Earth.  And then I need the evidence in the meteorite to, you know, support that -- a conclusion other than that.  So if the amino acids were made out in space, they should actually have an equal mixture of left-handed and right-handed amino acids.  They shouldn't have that predominant left-handed excess that biology shows.  So if I take a bacteria and I run it through my meteorite processing methods, I'll get all L amino acids.  And a little bit of it gets converted back to D during the process.  So a meteorite, the initial sort of baseline hypothesis is that if it's from the meteorite, it should be a 50/50 mixture.  And if it's skewed towards left-handed, then I have to assume it's biological contamination unless there's some other piece of evidence that tells me that, you know, no, this really did actually happen out in space.    [00:41:26] >> For example, way more right-handed amino acids, right?    [00:41:30] >> So that would be, you know, the ideal scenario, especially when looking for life.    [00:41:35] >> Yeah.    [00:41:36] >> There are other less sort of obvious markers that we can look at.  So one of them has to do with stable isotope ratios.  And so if we think about something like carbon, it normally has in the most abundant form of carbon has six protons and six neurons.  And it's carbon-12.    [00:41:54] >> Okay.    [00:41:54] >> And then about 1% of carbon on Earth is carbon-13.  And then some trace amount is carbon-14, which is actually radioactive.  And so that's what they use for radioactive dating.    [00:42:05] >> Okay.    [00:42:05] >> And so things that are found on Earth tend to be enriched in carbon-12 relative to carbon-13.  And then even furthermore, things that are processed by biology on Earth really like carbon-12 and they don't like carbon-13 very much.  Now, what's interesting is if you go out into a very cold environment, so out in sort of our pre-sun, our protosolar nebula where places were much colder, you actually prefer the heavy isotopes.  So carbon-13 is actually favored over carbon-12 more so relative to the preference on Earth.  So it's not like you have 10 times as much carbon-13, it's like 1.01% carbon-13 instead of, you know, 1% carbon-13.  And so from these very small signal differences, you can actually tell that something was actually made out in space rather than processed by biology on Earth.  And it's these kind of subtle differences that they actually use in, like, Olympics events to determine whether people were using steroids.    [00:43:11] >> Oh, really?    [00:43:12] >> Because our biochemistry produces different, like, testosterone than, like, soy plants if you're getting it from plants.  And so you can actually tell from the isotopic signatures whether the testosterone in an athlete came from them or if it was produced in a lab or grown in, you know, some plant somewhere.    [00:43:32] >> Wow.  The answer's in the details.    [00:43:34] >> Yes.    [00:43:34] >> Literally you're looking at the finest details and even the slightest change, you can tell if it's otherworldly.  That's pretty cool.    [00:43:42] >> Yeah.  And that's where you have to start with the hypothesis that this is contamination.    [00:43:47] >> Yeah.    [00:43:48] >> You know?  Unless you can prove that it's not.    [00:43:51] >> Okay.  So then -- so then is there an effort to go out and, you know, find something more pristine?  Maybe rather than doing -- getting a meteorite maybe go out and get an asteroid that has not touched the Earth's atmosphere, is there something we're doing now?    [00:44:09] >> Yep.  That would be OSIRIS-REx.    [00:44:11] >> Okay.    [00:44:12] >> So OSIRIS-REx mission is on its way to Bennu.  It will collect samples from that asteroid.  It is a carbonaceous body.  We can tell this by, you know, spectroscopy at a distance.  And actually, what we're touching on here is a sample return missions and why you would want them.  This is actually really nice conversation leading up to it.  For example, let me explain why you want to do missions like this in general.  Let me use the example of Mars.  Okay?  We're seriously talking about doing this, collecting samples from Mars and returning them from Earth now.  I had said earlier that we already have a quarter of metric ton of Martian meteorites on Earth.  So if you're just going to go get more for the sake of getting more, it's really not a really use of your resources.  But we also talked about how any meteorite that falls to Earth, you have to assume it's contaminated.  And so what you -- the really nice things you get out of a sample return mission that you can't get from meteorites is you get to collect materials where you to great detail know their contamination and alteration history.   [00:45:25] And by and large you're going to get stuff that's very minimally altered.  That's usually one of design goals of the mission -- definitely part of the ones we've ever done.  So you control the contamination history of the meteorite, and you get to know to great detail what it is by monitoring during the course of the mission.  You also get to select your samples.  For the example of Mars samples, what we can do is collect types of rock that we don't have in the Martian meteorite collection.  Sedimentary rocks take very poorly to getting pounded by a meteorite and blasted off the planet.  They tend to turn into dust and you never see them.  But we can go and carefully collect these.  Basically, the meteorites that survive the trip from Mars to Earth tend to be very, very tough rocks.  Now we can go and carefully collect the ones that we are actually more interested in, in some respects for investigating the hypothesis of past or present life on that planet -- the sedimentary rocks, the evaporites, the very friable, crumbly stuff that may preserve evidence of ancient organics.   [00:46:34] Those we can collect.  So -- and finally, you get to know exactly where your rock came from.  When you look at a meteorite, you know, most meteorites, Martian meteorites, we can say, \"Where this from?  Well, it's from Mars, you know, somewhere on the planet.\"  If you go and do a sample return mission, you know the contamination history, you get to select samples that you don't otherwise have access to, and you know exactly where it came from on the planet.  And you can take everything you learned about it in the lab and apply it to, you know, an outcrop, a spot, a crater, a lithology, some location on that planet and start to build the greater history of the planet in great detail that way.  So that -- whether it's for Mars or for Bennu or, you know, eventually comets or otherwise, that's kind of the driving impetus for doing these sample return missions.    [00:47:26] >> Hey well, I'm going to stay optimistic and say if we explore some of these spots in the more pristine environment of Mars, I think we can maybe look for the origins of life that way.    [00:47:37] >> But if there's -- you know, so as Marc was saying, you know, the rocks that we get on Earth from meteorites are really hard, tough ones.  And so, you know, the chances of life living in a solidified lava flow is probably a little bit different than if you could actually get material that was in a location that we think was the bottom of a lake, say, where would expect life to have existed and perhaps get actually trapped into that sedimentary material.    [00:48:05] >> Yeah, that's true.  Because location, location, location, right?  [Laughs]    [00:48:09] >> It's a fair argument.  Like I said, you know, there's a lot of discussion about this.  It is a -- not all scientists are -- how do I put it?  We're still discussing it.    [00:48:23] [ Laughter ]    [00:48:25] >> More research is needed.    [00:48:26] >> More research.    [00:48:28] >> And scientists hate consensus.    [00:48:30] >> Ah.    [00:48:30] >> Yeah, pretty much.    [00:48:33] >> So then what's -- you said Bennu is carbaceous [phonetic]?  Is that the word?    [00:48:38] >> Carbonaceous.    [00:48:39] >> Okay.  Carbonaceous.    [00:48:40] >> It is black as coal.    [00:48:41] >> Black as coal.  So it's full of carbon.  Very interesting thing to observe.  So what's OSIRIS-REx going to do?  Is it going to land and bring something back or is it just going to stay there?  What's the mission like?    [00:48:53] >> Yeah.  So Bennu is about a half-kilometer-wide asteroid.  OSIRIS-REx launched in September of 2016.    [00:49:01] >> Okay.    [00:49:01] >> Rendezvous is going to be in 2018.    [00:49:05] >> All right.    [00:49:06] >> And actually, the spacecraft is going to orbit for about a year and a half and carefully map out surface of the asteroid to identify scientifically interesting regions that it can collect a sample from.  And the scientifically interesting question will be counterbalanced by safety.    [00:49:23] >> Ah.    [00:49:23] >> Because you can't, you know, really endanger the spacecraft while you're trying to collect the sample.    [00:49:27] >> Yeah.  Oh, that sharp mountain looks really, really interesting.    [00:49:31] >> Yeah.  Yeah, it's more important that you get the sample back than [Laughs] that you choose the exact-most scientifically interesting place.  And so the -- after finding a suitable location, the spacecraft is going to go down and it's got almost like a little reverse vacuum cleaner.  So it's got a little touch and go sample acquisition mechanism that will actually contact the surface of the asteroid.  And then it's got nitrogen gas that will it will actually blow into that surface.  And that will actually push the dust into the sample collector.  And so like I was saying, like a reverse vacuum cleaner.  You're blowing the dirt in.    [00:50:12] >> Blowing it, yeah.    [00:50:13] >> You know, that works on a rather small body because gravity is much less of an issue there.  So the mission requirement is to get at least 60 grams.  And from experiments on Earth and under similar gravity conditions, they should be able to get several hundred grams or more that will then be tucked away into a sample return capsule that will make its way back to Earth.  It will land.  I'm amazed that people can do this with orbital dynamics.  But it will land in Utah.    [00:50:45] >> Wow.    [00:50:46] >> In the desert in September of 2023.  And these samples will be transported to a curation facility and processed and then eventually made available to researchers all over the world who are interested in, you know, studying this material.    [00:51:01] >> Oh, that is cool.  Fire it out to space and land it in Utah.  That's -- that's a target.  That's quite a target practice right there.  That's pretty cool.  So I guess it's going to kind of be like -- so the moon rocks that we have here in our -- some of them have actually never been exposed to Earth's atmosphere, right?  They've been sealed.  Like, are we going to expect the same thing for OSIRIS-REx?  It's going to be sealed away from Earth's atmosphere?    [00:51:27] >> Some of the samples will be preserved for future research.    [00:51:31] >> Okay.    [00:51:31] >> I think the design of the capsule doesn't keep it entirely free of Earth's atmosphere.  But for what they're trying to do for the mission goals, that was appropriate.  But yeah, definitely some will be preserved away for future generations just like any other collections.    [00:51:49] >> All right.  That's a pretty cool mission.    [00:51:51] >> Yeah, yeah.  Looking forward to seeing it.    [00:51:54] >> Yeah.  2023, that will be a cool thing to watch it come back.  So, Aaron, since I have you here, I did kind of want to bring up DNA sequencing just because you -- you know, that's such an interesting thing that will happen on the International Space Station, literally sequencing DNA in real-time.  Can you kind of explain kind of what that project is all about?    [00:52:15] >> Yeah.  So this -- this is a project that actually has sort of two goals.  So one is, you know, crew health and human exploration.  And then I have my sort of ulterior motive or goal, which is looking for life elsewhere in the solar system.  So it's a nice marriage of two applications of the same technology.    [00:52:38] >> Pretty cool marriage.    [00:52:39] >> Yeah.    [00:52:40] >> Looking for life outside the solar system and studying astronauts in space.  Pretty cool pairing.    [00:52:44] >> Yeah.    [00:52:45] >> Yeah.    [00:52:45] >> And so this -- the DNA sequencing, we want to use it for crew health, to be able to do environmental monitoring.  And so you want to look on the International Space Station or ISS for microbes, be able to identify them to know if there's harmful organisms there.  And as we think about going beyond ISS, if you're going to send humans to Mars and they're going to go on a three-year mission, if the crew member shows signs of an infection, you know, we want to have a diagnostic capability to know, you know, so if you cough up some phlegm, okay, what's in that phlegm?  And then is that something that needs to be treated with an antibiotic or that something your body will clear on its own?  You know, be able to make informed decisions about that.  Because we're not going to be able to do resupply missions on -- it would hard to hit a moving target flying to Mars and catch up to it.    [00:53:40] >> Yeah.    [00:53:41] >> So we're trying to give that sort of in-flight, you know, diagnostic capability with the DNA sequencing.  And then when the humans get to Mars, you know, I'd like them to be able to go out and dig up a sample and extract it and actually look for life that's present on Mars.    [00:53:58] >> Wow.  So sequencing DNA is kind of like -- I'm trying to explain it in as laymen terms as possible to wrap my brain around it because it is pretty complicated stuff.  But it's basically identifying, right?    [00:54:08] >> Yeah.    [00:54:08] >> It's -- so if you said, you know, if they have a cough, they can do a sample and they know exactly what you're coughing up.  They know the exact makeup, and then you can identify what kind of antibiotic you need to take because you know exactly what's inside your body.    [00:54:21] >> Yeah, yeah.  So DNA, you know, is like a language.  It's got an alphabet.  There's only four letters -- there's A, G, C, and T. But all life on Earth uses that same alphabet from the tiniest microbe to humans.  And so it's sort of like books in a library, right?  The books are all different because they have more letters or less letters that are arranged in different words.  And so, you know, analyzing -- I guess sequencing DNA is like taking a page out of that book and then searching for all the words on that page.  And then if you had a computer that could process it, you could say, \"Oh, that page came from A Tale of Two Cities.  Or that page came from this book.\"    [00:55:07] >> All right.    [00:55:08] >> Or that paragraph.  And so the more of that page or paragraph, the better of a match you can get, you know?  If you have a chapter of a book, then you can nail it down to -- discounting plagiarism.  You know?  [Laughs] You can nail it down to a single book or a single organism.    [00:55:25] >> All right.  That's pretty cool.  Although, I mean, for an alphabet of four letters, you know, life is pretty diverse [Laughs] for such a tiny alphabet.  And, you know, you're taking analogies from books and I'm imagining the books.  But four letters that can make all these different things, that's pretty astounding.    [00:55:45] >> Yeah.  Well, so a virus can have around 50,000 of these letters in its entire genome.  So all the instructions that a virus needs to do to infect a cell and then get the cell to make more copies of it all encapsulated in 50,000 letters.    [00:56:01] >> Whoa.    [00:56:01] >> And that's something like the microbe that that virus might affect could have several million of these letters.  And then humans are about 2.5 billion of these letters or 3 billion.  And then actually, there are certain plants that even have, like, ten-fold more of these letters in their genome.  But it's a -- you know, it's pretty amazing that biology can do so much with a limited -- sort of the limited alphabet.    [00:56:31] >> That's true.  But thank goodness there's no -- there's no word in the English language that's 10 million letters long.    [00:56:38] >> Yeah.    [00:56:38] >> So that's pretty good.  It would be really hard to write A Tale of Two Cities with [Laughs] -- you would probably get one word in and still it would be the biggest novel you've ever seen in your life [Laughs].    [00:56:51] >> Yeah.  An interesting thing about that is they are actually starting to switch to -- or trying to develop DNA as a way to store information.  So it's like a new data, I guess, like replacing solid state drives or spinning hard drives is to encapsulate things in DNA.    [00:57:09] >> Whoa.  All right.  Well, it's got a lot of storage, right?  Because you can --    [00:57:12] >> Yeah, yeah.    [00:57:13] >> -- you can fit it.  Wow.  Okay.  That's difficult to wrap my mind around [Laughs].  I'm thinking about storing something in, like, a cell.    [00:57:22] >> Can I talk about something else weird, too?    [00:57:24] >> Yes, please.    [00:57:25] >> No [Laughs].    [00:57:26] >> This is not the place for that [Laughs].    [00:57:28] >> So one of the things interesting that we've -- you know, we've talked about life as we know it and the search for life.  And then there's this concept of being able to identify life as you don't know it.    [00:57:41] >> Whoa.    [00:57:42] >> And so we've talked about, you know, left-handed and right-handed proteins and it would be great if you could find right-handed proteins or amino acids that aren't on Earth, or left-handed sugars, or sugars that aren't on Earth.  So that's one of the cool things for me about the DNA Sequencer Project is the way that it sequences DNA has actually got these little tiny pores that are actually just big enough for a single strand of DNA to pass through.  And when there's nothing in the pore, you get basically an open current.  And then as the DNA molecule passes through it, it blocks that pore.  And so the current is reduced.  And the reduction in current tells you something about the sequence of DNA that's passing through it.  So, like, AGCTA would have a different signal blocking than GACTA, for example.  And so it's an entirely electrochemical way of detecting this.  And you can apply it to other molecules that we might not necessarily recognize as life.   [00:58:46] So --    [00:58:46] >> L, M, N, O, P.    [00:58:48] >> Yes [Laughs].  That's exactly right.  And so people are using this technology to sequence RNA, which is different than DNA.  It differs in the sugar, so it's deoxyribose versus ribose.  But in RNA an interesting thing is that you have more than the A, G, C, and T -- actually, RNA uses U instead of T. But in things like ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA, which are present in biology, extensive modification is made of the bases.  So there's actually, like, 118 different letters that show up in RNA that people are figuring out how to actually characterize using this nanopore sequencing.    [00:59:28] >> Wow.    [00:59:29] >> And so I'm interested -- and not just me, a number of people are looking at this -- but, you know, making a more universal life detection mechanism.  So, you know, if you can do DNA by now you don't need the deoxyribose, it can be any sugar in there.    [00:59:46] >> Oh.    [00:59:46] >> Or instead of the A, G, C, and T letters, if you can L, M, N, O, P as Marc said.    [00:59:51] >> Yeah.  It will just look for letters and then just see what pops up.    [00:59:54] >> Yeah.    [00:59:54] >> Yeah.    [00:59:55] >> Yeah.  And so you lose some of the resolution.  So maybe you won't know that it was an A. But if you start seeing a polymer of semirepeating, you know, signals or letters, you know, at some point that starts to tell you there's information there.    [01:00:12] >> Oh, wow.    [01:00:13] >> Yeah.  That's where it gets really deep [Laughs], is that, you know, probably one of the most important biosignatures or biomarkers is information.  Right?  You have to have instructions for how to do whatever it is that the organism is doing and a way to copy that information.    [01:00:29] >> Wow.  All right.  I can think of, like, 100 different ways we can go and just go on a tangent and talk about all these crazy topics.  It's amazing.  But we do have to wrap up.  So I kind of wanted to end on something like a -- some of the guests I like to bring and ask this question specifically because we're at the Johnson Space Center and it's human space flight.  But for you guys, you know, in the search for life, why from your point of view is human exploration so important to discovery, especially in the field of looking for the origins of life?    [01:01:01] >> I can give my answer, sure.    [01:01:02] >> Yeah.    [01:01:03] >> You know, basically humans have an innate need to explore.  It's something written into, I think, most children.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of adults tend to lose that over time.  But it's there.  The -- we can explore with robots.  You know, I'll use some air quotes, you can't see them.  It's exploration, but in a sense you're -- with a robot, you are exploring through a computer screen.  And that's fine, you do learn.  It is exploration.  But on -- it may not be -- you know, at what point is that no longer satisfactory?  I'd answer that with a question: At what point do you just have to go there and see it yourself?  You know, there's technical arguments for why you want send people.  They are, I believe, much better in a field environment when you're investigating something.  You know, they can turn around data, they can come up with new ideas, they can process things.   [01:02:07] You know, you can get a whole lot more out of having somebody kneel down, pick up a rock, and turn it over in their hand in some instances than some of the data you get from rovers and landers and such.  You know, that's been my experience.  But fundamentally there's that innate drive to explore.  And yeah, that's the question.  You know, when is watching all this through a computer screen going to be unsatisfactory?    [01:02:39] >> How about, you Aaron?    [01:02:41] >> I got to follow that up?    [01:02:43] [ Laughter ]  So I would, you know, echo the -- the -- just the much more versatile skillset that, you know, a human has compared to a robot, you know, where a human can look out for several miles and walk and adjust its path in a pretty easy way and, you know, not get stuck somewhere.  So you can, you know, explore a lot more ground in a given, you know, time period.  If you want to dig a hole, you can dig a deeper hole because you've got a shovel and you just keep digging until you decide that -- you know, it's easier for a human to make these decisions themselves than, you know, try to communicate all that to a -- to a robot.  But I think, yeah, as Marc was saying, it comes back to that sort of innate curiosity, you know, where -- what's over the mountain, what's across the river, what's at the bottom of the ocean.  You know, we didn't know that these other places would be good or great or, you know, useful.   [01:03:44] But you kind have to know.  And so, you know, going to Mars or the moon and learning how to live on the moon or learning how to live on Mars teaches you something about how to live on Earth, how to travel in space, how to live on other planets.  And then it serves as a stepping stone.  Okay, well, what's beyond Mars?  What's beyond our solar system?  You know?  We're going to need to develop light speed travel and all that.  But, you know, assuming that we're able to do those things, you know, it just -- it enables the next frontier, if you will.    [01:04:21] >> Very cool.  Guys, thanks so much for coming on today.  This was a fascinating topic.  And always at the end of these I get so charged, especially when we end with, like, the why.  I'm like, \"Yes, let's do it.  Let's go out and explore.\"  So thanks so much for coming on and talking about life.  Can't wait to follow it up with one of these weird tangents that we almost went on today.  But thanks again, guys.    [01:04:40] >> No, our pleasure.    [01:04:42] [ Music ]    [01:04:50] >> Houston, go ahead.    [01:04:50] >> [Inaudible] of the space shuttle.    [01:04:52] >> Roger, zero G and I feel fine.    [01:04:54] [ Inaudible ]    [01:04:55] >> We came in peace for all mankind.    [01:04:57] >> It's actually a huge honor to bring [inaudible].    [01:05:00] >> Not because they are easy but because they are hard.    [01:05:02] >> [Inaudible] Houston, welcome to space.    [01:05:05] [ Music ]    [01:05:06] >> Hey.  Thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked about Dr. Aaron Burton and Dr. Marc Fries about life in the solar system, went off on a couple awesome tangents and had some great conversations just about everything life in the universe and just kind of scratched the surface, really.  We can do a bunch more episodes just on this topic alone.  But if you cannot wait and need to know this stuff right now, both Aaron and Marc are part of the astromaterials group known as ARES here.  You can go to ARES.jsc.nasa.gov to learn all about the different initiatives.  Just going on, on astromaterials alone and that's -- you can learn more about OSIRIS-REx there, and you can learn more about meteorites and curation.  And even you can learn how to get your hands on a meteorite, if you are dying to get your hands on and study the sample material yourself and maybe search for organic compounds.  Otherwise if you just want to focus on just OSIRIS-REx, go to NASA.gov/OSIRIS-REx.  On social media if you want to talk to us there, there is the Johnson Space Center accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.   [01:06:09] Also astromaterials has their own, NASA ARES on several different accounts.  Otherwise you can find them, it's NASA Astromaterials.  If you want to use the hashtag #AskNASA on any one of those platforms, any one of those pages, you can submit an idea.  Just make sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast so we can find it and answer it in a later episode for you or perhaps dedicate an entire episode to it.  So this podcast was recorded on November 28th, 2017.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Tracy Calhoun, and Jenny Knots.  Thanks to again Dr. Aaron Burton and Dr. Marc Fries for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week."

            "description": "Dan Huot (Host):  Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, this is Episode 34, A Seismic Journey.  I'm Dan Huot, I'm filling for Gary Jordan, and I will be your host today.  If you're new to the show, we bring in NASA experts, the scientists, the engineers, the astronauts, all to tell you everything about NASA.  Today, we're talking with Drew Feustel, who's a U.S. astronaut, and he's about to launch to the International Space Shuttle in March of 2018.  We talked about his education in geology and seismology, some of his previous spaceflight experience, flying on the Hubble Space Telescope, and some of his expectations for his first long-duration stay in space aboard the space station.  So with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Drew Feustel.  Enjoy!    Music & Radio Transmissions    Host:  I mean just sitting there, so -- you took quite a path, it almost seems like the way you became an astronaut, it was just this -- this long line of dominos that all had to fall in place.    Drew Feustel:   That's exactly what I was thinking when I was talking about it, was that it's dominos.  You know?  Or I like to think of it as like swiss cheese.  They use swiss cheese analogy a lot of times for accidents chuckling, maybe that's just an accident, when multiple pieces of swiss cheese, and if you line it up just right, one of the holes, you know, a series of the holes will line up so you get a straight path through, you know, all the pieces of cheese.  And I think of my life sometimes that way, I think it's true for everybody's life, but you don't always -- you don't always turn around to reflect on, you know, you could probably make the same analogy, you could go, how did I get from A to B, right?  Maybe you have that same story.    Host:  Well, I was sitting there thinking about, as you were talking, and I was literally tracing it back.  So I ended up at NASA, I trace it back to a memory where my roommate and I were sitting around in college and we had no money, and we were like, let's go get jobs!    Drew Feustel:   Yeah laughing.    Host:  Let's go sign up for internships.    Drew Feustel:   There you go!    Host:  And that's how I ended up getting an internship at NASA.  So that's how I kind of ended up here, but, I mean, walk us through kind of, because yours -- yours goes a little bit further back than mine.  I mean, you can trace your story all the way back to...    Drew Feustel:   Great, great uncle...    Host:  Pre 1900's.    Drew Feustel:   Yeah, 19, I think -- my great uncle -- so we'll start with -- the -- Purdue will love this, because it starts with Purdue University, I think, I guess it does, but my great uncle attended Purdue and graduated in 1905.  So I guess he started probably in like 1900 or 1901 and received an engineering degree in civil engineering.  And when I was in my early 20's, I was probably 19 or 20, I think my grandmother showed me an obituary about my uncle, my great uncle, who was a Purdue graduate, and he became, I like to think of him as like a titan in industry, but he was a public servant, worked in the utilities -- for the utilities commission in I believe around the Chicago area, and then eventually in Indiana.  He was a public servant, but he was quite prominent in his -- in his arena, and when he passed away, there was, you know, people wrote obituaries about him, and the things that they said about him were really impressive to me, and these were the things that my grandmother gave me to read, and the stories that were told about him by the governor of Indiana, who was his close, personal friend, really struck me that this individual had achieved so many great things in his life, he died in his, I think it was his late 40's, he was just really very successful as a public servant, and -- and so many individuals who held prominent roles, you know, the president of Purdue University at the time, the governor of Indiana, these people were saying things about that really -- really were impressionable to me, and inspired me to maybe model my, you know, my, not my career, but model myself after what I perceived him to be based on what others said about him.   Not that anybody should care necessarily about what people think of you, but, you know, public perception is important, and -- and if you -- it's good to have role models, and this was a good role model for me, at least I felt it was.  But that inspired me to, you know, create goals in my life that were very broad and advanced, and look for opportunities that I may not otherwise have been inspired to -- to pursue.    Host:  And so that was just kind of domino one, and then -- so Purdue...    Drew Feustel:   Purdue.    Host:  Seems to be a central location for a lot of things that happened in your life.  So you ended up going there.    Drew Feustel:   Great, great PR for the school.  They -- my father and my uncle, my father and his brother, both were Purdue graduates in the 1960's.  And so while I was at community college, there was really no other option that I thought for myself, I thought, well, you know, Purdue has been in the family, it's pretty prominent, and Purdue had, at that time, graduated 20-some astronauts, or individuals who eventually became astronauts, including...    Host:  And you were already thinking astronaut at this point.    Drew Feustel:   Well, I mean, you know, talking about Neil Armstrong, Gus Grissom, Gene Cernan, some of the greats, you know, there's 20 of us, 24 of us now I believe, and I was already thinking, astronaut program, but I didn't really know how it was going to work out.  I mean, I went -- I'm -- I'm the only Purdue graduate who’s not an engineer.  I'm a geoscientist, and I, you know, I didn't really know, well, I didn't know how I -- how being at Purdue somehow made you an engineer, and, you know, it doesn't, but it just so happens that a lot of Purdue grads had become, or a lot of astronauts are -- are Purdue grads.  So -- so, yeah, I made the choice to come to Purdue and -- and study geosciences, and I thought, at the time, I thought, well, if I'm a geoscientist or a geophysicist, I can eventually be an astronaut and look at mining resources on other planets, for example, or -- or something along those lines, and that's not what I'm doing now, but at least that's the goal I had in mind at the time, when I was there.   But at Purdue, I met my wife, and my wife was from Canada, and that leads to another domino in this story, which is, you know, how is it that I finally made that connection to NASA?  And my wife and I met at Purdue.  We were married while we were there, and when she finished her degree, and I finished mine at the same time, we both finished our master's degrees, she was interested in moving back to Canada, back to her home, and I was interested in doing something, in fact, if I hadn't met my wife, my plan was to possibly join the Air Force, because I wanted to fly jets.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Drew Feustel:   You know, I grew up wanting to, you know, go fast, fly jets, whatever, but we met and I realized that maybe I wasn't ready to run off to the military just yet, and maybe there were some other options.  So I pursued a PhD in geophysics.  And through my connections, my advisor at Purdue University, he suggested I go to Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, and speak with an individual there who was working in mining seismology, underground mine -- underground mining seismology, which is really the study of microearthquakes in -- in mines, underground mines, to understand how the mine and the -- the earth is reacting to removal of material during the mining process.  So, I went to Queens with my wife, and within the first few months of being there, this was in 1991, I saw a TV program called W5, which is a lot like 60 Minutes, and -- and the story was about the astronaut -- the Canadian astronaut selection where Chris Hadfield, Julie Payette, Dave Williams where these individuals were all selected as astronauts.   And I was fascinated by that program, and I thought, that's really cool.  Those guys are doing the things that I want to do when I grow up.  That was 1991.  While we were in Canada, both of my boys were -- were born, two children were born in Kingston, Ontario.  I actually attained Canadian citizenship there in Canada, so I'm a dual citizen.    Host:  Oh, wow!    Drew Feustel:   My children are dual citizens because they were born in Canada to U.S. citizens.  My wife is a dual citizen, because she was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and became a naturalized Canadian in the early 70's.  So we're all a family of dual citizens, Canadian and U.S. And while we were there, I had a friend from Purdue University call me, a colleague of mine that I went to school with at Purdue, and he was, at the time, working for Exxon -- Exxon Exploration Company, now Exxonmobil company, and he said, hey, Exxon's looking for some people, are you interested in coming down for a job interview?  I thought, well, that's great, because the Johnson Space Center is right around the corner, and not only would this be a great opportunity with Exxon, but maybe, you know, maybe now there's a chance for me to apply to the space program when I get down there.    Host:  And, again, you're -- you're still thinking astronaut.    Drew Feustel:   I'm still thinking astronaut, but I was -- I was, you know, I was pursuing the things that I really liked to do.  I -- I love geology, I love geoscience, I still read geoscience journals, you know, and periodicals and try to stay up on the current trends in the industry.  I mean, I really like that stuff, and that was why I did it as a career, because I got something out of it.  And I would still love to do that again, at some point in my life, you know, and when career number three comes around, maybe I'll be, you know, back doing exploration, I don't know what, as a geoscientist.  But we came to Houston, and pause I attended a conference early on, once I got here, oil and gas conference, and one of the individuals who attended this conference, whose name I saw on the agenda, was a person, a geophysicist by the name of Rob -- Rob -- Rob Stewart.  Rob Stewart, at the time, was working up in Calgary, and he was selected, as a Canadian astronaut, on that program that I saw in Canada in 1991.   He was one of the guys that was selected as a Canadian astronaut.  And Rob, for personal reasons, was unable to accept that position, but he was selected.  So he knew about the space program.  He knew these individuals.  Rob is now actually working, he's the, I think he's the chair of Geophysics at University of Houston, here, right here in town.  So I see Rob occasionally, I've done a lot of work over the years together, related to NASA, and related to astronaut training, because we always have a component of astronaut training that's centered around geology and geophysics.  Every astronaut that comes into the program learns something about geology and geophysics because of the work that we did on the moon and because of what we believe we'll do when we go back to the moon and eventually onto Mars.  A lot of the work we will do is geotechnical in nature, and so that -- we think that's an important component of astronaut skillset.  Anyways, that's a -- just a sidebar, but back to the story of I went to this conference, Rob Stewart was there, I talked to Rob Stewart, and I said, Rob, what can you tell me about the space program?   I'm just a guy who wants to be an astronaut at some point in my life, and he -- he said, well, why don't you come down to the Johnson Space Center with me tomorrow, because I'm going to go meet my friends who are still my friends that I met back in 1991, you know, six years before at this -- when they were all selected.  And so we had plans to do that, and on that day that we were supposed to go down, it was the same day, I believe, that one of the progress vehicles ran into the Mir Space Station, and so there was so much activity down here in Houston that the visit was called off.  And so...    Host:  It's almost like you've had all of these fortuitous events, and now a setback.    Drew Feustel:   A setback, yeah, and I was a little bit disappointed, you know, I thought, wow, that was my chance to go to the space center with -- with Rob Stewart, and he was going to introduce me to all these people.  And so Rob Stewart left, went back to Calgary, and a month or two later I called him in Calgary and said, you know, I'm still interested in that -- in that -- in meeting some of these people or learning more about it.  What can you tell me?  And he said, well, I can't tell you much because I didn't -- I didn't go there, right, I'm still here, I'm still a geoscientist, and I -- and I made that decision.  He said, so why don't you just call somebody and talk to them?  Just -- I said, well, alright, I'll -- thanks for the suggestion and hung up the phone with Rob and then I just looked in the phone book and got...    Host:  You just look up, astronaut?    Drew Feustel:   I just looked up the phone number for Johnson Space Center, and I called the operator at Johnson Space Center, and I said, I would like to speak to Chris Hadfield, because he was the other name that I knew from watching this program in 1991, he was the other Canadian astronaut.  And Rob said he knew him, so, you know, I figured, well, I can just call him and talk to him.  And after being put on hold twice, going through the, you know, the different operators at the Johnson Space Center, finally Chris Hadfield picked up the phone and said, hi, this is Chris Hadfield.  And I said, hi, Rob Stewart said I should call you!  Laughter    Host:  I just want to prepare you for random people calling in now, saying, I'd like to talk to Drew Feustel, I know Rob.    Drew Feustel:   Yeah.  Well, you know, in life, sometimes it's about who you know and not necessarily what you know, you know, so that was -- that was just a door, right, there was a doorknob that I just reached out and turned, and I think that's important for people to realize.  Like, you know, by not taking the opp -- those opportunities, you guarantee that you're not going to open a door, right?  But if you take an opportunity, there's a chance that you could open one door and all the doors behind it.  And I think it's a good lesson in life that, you know, you do have to step out there sometimes and take those risks.  The only thing you can be assured of is that if you don't take those risks, nothing's going to happen, right?  So there's always those opportunities.    Host:  The domino won't fall if you don't recognize that it's there.    Drew Feustel:   Yeah, exactly!  You got to see it first to make it happen.  So -- so, anyways, that's, you know, that's kind of how all the pieces laid out and, you know, I met Chris, and we -- we realized we had some common interests.  I, you know, he plays guitar a lot more than I do, but I play guitar and -- and we -- we played music a lot together back then, and we were both avid water skiers, so we spent a lot of time on the water skiing and I, you know, through that friendship, which was really, you know, just really quite -- I thought was a great relationship, we had a lot of fun doing different things, but I got exposed to a lot of people in the astronaut corp and NASA and what was going on down here, and I was -- I like to think I was in the right place at the right time with the right competition to be selected in 2000 as an astronaut.  And, you know, I -- if I were competing now with the people who are being selected as astronauts, I would not be here.   You know, they're just a lot of brilliant people that have shown up really after I got here, and it's just amazing to see the caliber of folks that are coming in, but, again, the right place, the right time with the right competition allowed me to be here, but when I, you know, the story is pretty long, but you can link all the pieces together and -- and realize that it comes all the way back to probably my great, great uncle, I can't -- great, great or great, I think he's my great, great uncle, in the late -- in the early 1900's attending Purdue University, that was the start of all of those links in the chain that led me to, you know, being -- being here where I am today, and, you know, between him, learning about him, and meeting my wife at Purdue University, those I think are the two really key pivotal things that happened in my life, and it's -- it's amazing now to realize that there was just those -- really those two things.   If those two things hadn't existed, you know, I wouldn't have the opportunities that I have now, and I -- I wouldn't have, I think, the opportunity to try to inspire somebody else, you know, to do those great things, and I hope that's -- I hope that's a big component of, you know, the opportunities that we have, as astronauts, is that we do inspire people and we do allow people to reach out and make that step that they might not have taken have they not had somebody to -- to model, you know, their lives, or something, or their decisions, or at least, you know, create that spark.  I hope that's what -- the effect that we have on people.    Host:  Well, like I said, be ready for those phone calls.    Drew Feustel:   Yeah, those phone calls laughter.  It's fine!  You know?    Host:  Well, so, I do have one kind of fun question.  So you said, you know, geology is still, you know, it's definitely still a passion for you.  If you could go practice geology anywhere in the universe, any planet, any asteroid, anything, what -- what would you do?  Where would you want to go?    Drew Feustel:   Well, I don't know if you'd want to send me, because I didn't say I was a good geologist Dan laughing, I just said I like...    Host:  Take all of the decision making process out of it, but you, Drew Feustel, we're going to -- we're going to launch anywhere in the universe to go practice your craft, where would you want to go?    Drew Feustel:   Well, everywhere and anywhere.  But maybe not to get stuck there.  You saw the movie, Interstellar, right?    Host:  Mhm.    Drew Feustel:   Kind of story about people who went out into places and ended up getting stuck there, and that's -- that's not ideal, but I think it's cool to think that you could go to different places, different planetary bodies, where there is geology to be discovered, new things that we don't see on planet earth.  I mean, in a practical -- practically thinking, right, I think what we -- what we need to do, as a space organization and as a -- as a -- as a world, really, as a world species, is to establish a presence on the moon, and our ability to live there permanently over, you know, a long duration, like really, no kidding, have a moon base that we can live on and do live on at all times, as species.  And then develop the capability to go onto Mars, and it's -- those place -- you know, humans were built to live on earth.  It will be possible without assistance of life support systems to live on the moon and on Mars, but it's important.   At some point in the history of humans, I think it's highly likely that we will find an earth-like planetary body for us to live on.  Now, you know, it might be 10,000 years from now, it might be, you know, another 4,000 years, I don't know when it's going to happen, but at some point, I think humans will, or human-like species will live and maybe will all evolve from here.  We'll live somewhere else out in the universe on something like earth, but, you know, earth is a pretty special place.  And this is where humans were designed to live, and when we leave this planet, we will change, as a species, we -- because our bodies change and adapt to the environment that they're in.  Naturally.  Takes a long time, but we do!  I mean, we see that with different people around the world, how the different climates affect, you know, what we're like as a species around the planet, and that -- the same thing will happen to us.   I mean, we just see, you know, for example, we go to space as astronauts.  If we didn't work out every single day, right, we -- we would eventually lose all the muscles in our legs, right, the bones become brittle, because the body doesn't need to put any nutrients there or fire those muscles, and if you don't use them, so if you don't use them, you're going to lose them.  So we have to be careful about the way we start to explore space and realize that as we become an interplanetary or interspace species, that we'll -- we'll always be faced with the challenge of returning to earth in this one-gravity environment that we know here and being able to sustain that -- those gravity loads and -- and live here and walk here and exist here.  It's going it be interesting.  I mean, I hopefully will have a way to observe what happens to the human species as we, you know, go off into the ether of -- of life, but I just -- I don't know, I don't know those answers.    Host:  Well, we're not sending you off into the ether yet laughter, we're just going to send you to the International Space Station, so.    Drew Feustel:   We'll keep it down close to earth for now.    Host:  We'll keep it a little bit down, closer to earth for now, but, I mean, even this, this is going to be kind of a significant jump in spaceflight experience, because your previous two were much shorter missions, albeit, you know, very jam-packed, especially Hubble, which, by the way, Hubble, that was -- when I came to NASA, that was the first mission that I really followed, because I came here as a student in the summer of 2009, and so that was the first time where like I -- I knew everything that was going on with that mission, so that one's always stood out in my mind.  And that -- I mean, that had to be a really special one for you, because that was your first flight.    Drew Feustel:   Yeah, I mean, it was -- it was great.  I think everybody's first flight is -- is amazing.  I would just -- it's pause -- it was -- it was really a unique opportunity to see Hubble, and I didn't -- I didn't realize how unique it was until, you know, then we went to the Space Station and now Hubble continues to operate, I mean, but -- but that's what we do in the space program.  I mean, before Hubble, there was, you know, it was SkyLab and Apollo-Soyuz, and, you know, Mir and Salyut, and, you know, the shuttle, Apollo, I mean, there was all those things, right, and they were all special and unique, and Hubble was one of those neat -- neat aspects of space and space exploration that -- that humans were a part of.  So, you know, we -- none of us think any mission is more special than the other, just Hubble was a really cool thing to be able to work on.  I wish, you know, everybody could have had that same experience.   Because it was fun and it was busy and it was a different mission.  But everything we do is different, you know, and I sometimes don't even feel like I've really flown in space yet, until I, you know, having seen everybody go to the space station and be there for, you know, four or five or six months, you know, that's living and working in space.  And that's what I'm looking forward to, is having that real longer-term experience.  You know, shuttle missions are amazing, they're jam-packed, and our space program wouldn't be where it is right now if it weren't for all the shuttle missions leading up to it and the short -- short duration missions, but I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to living and working in space, and I feel like it'll be really the, you know, really to -- to fully experience that means you need to be there for more than two weeks, and so that's what I'm looking forward to.    Host:  You're going to feel a little bit more like one of those future humans living out beyond the earth's realm of influence probably.    Drew Feustel:   I guess -- I guess I'll get to feel like I can -- I can absorb it more personally instead of what I see in pictures.  I mean, I have pictures from Hubble, I have pictures from Space Station, but, you know, they -- those days pass so quickly that now hopefully I'll have more of those experiences become part of, you know, part of my psyche, I'll have more of those images, those -- those things burned into my memory as opposed to having to remember what they were like by looking at a picture.    Host:  It's almost like you want on a short family vacation and now you're actually going to go live overseas for...    Drew Feustel:   Yeah, go live over there, that's right.  That's where you get a job as a, you know, a surfing instructor in Hawaii instead of just visiting for two weeks and taking lessons, you know?    Host:  And, I mean, I know when you guys are up there, so, you're a bit of a gearhead, you know, you're restoring cars and things of that nature, when you're on the shuttle, I imagine you didn't have a whole lot of opportunity to tinker and fix things, but with Space Station, you get to play pretty much space repairman.  Has any of that got you kind of excited, to be able to take some of those things apart and put them back together?    Drew Feustel:   You know, much of what we do in space is not by our choice.  And I am excited about that, and I hope that the space station program takes advantage of the opportunity.  You know, I'm not -- I'm no Don Pettit, you know, Don can create a nuclear reactor while he's up there, you know, a gyro stabilized platform, but I can fix things and I know my way around tools, and I hope we have a chance to do some of those things in space, that the program is going to take advantage of that, not that they don't anyways, but, you know, maybe if there's some things that we've been thinking about fixing for a long time, and had some stuff on the backburner, I'm happy to do the science, I'm excited to do the science, but, you know, you can only -- you can only neglect things for so long.  And I'm not -- we don't neglect anything on ISS, but there are probably projects we could get done that we just haven't had the motivation to do before, and maybe this is a chance to take care of some of those mechanical things that we just haven't had an opportunity in the past to take care of.   So, we'll see!  I'm sure there'll be plenty to do.  I'm not hoping that anything breaks, you know, you never want that, it's always -- it's kind of like, yeah, you never want anything to break.  You just want it to keep working, but if it does, we're there, and I'm -- I'm ready to -- to help try to get things back -- back in one piece if we can.    Host:  Well, I know we're about out of time with you.  I did have one more of those fun, hypotheticals.  So, you are, like I said, you are a bit of a gearhead.  You've been taking apart cars since you were, what, like 13 or something?    Drew Feustel:   Yeah.    Host:  So, if you could have any spacecraft in history transported to your garage for you to take apart and put it back together, have fun with, which one would you pick?    Drew Feustel:   Laughing Umm clears throat, that's a great question, but I don't know if I would want a spacecraft in my garage laughter to take apart and put back together.  Mainly because I'm not a rocket scientist, and, you know, I'm not sure I'd know the first thing about building a -- building a rocket.  But, you know, what I'm looking forward to really is the next generation of spacecraft.  I think what we've done in the past has been amazing, and the capabilities that we have achieved with the rockets we've built, you know, it's gotten us to this point, and this is a very dynamic stage in human space exploration, human and robotic space exploration, and we, as humans, have only been exploring space for 50 years.  You know, physically exploring space, and, to me, that's just like at the infancy of the program.  In 50 years, by any measure of institution or corporation or anything, or a life, is nothing.   And so, I think it's really exciting right now that we are just at the beginning stages of -- of how we explore and expand out into the universe, and it's all happening like right now.  I mean, it's -- we're really starting to advance in our capabilities, and it's not just NASA, but it's the private corporations that are getting involved, and I think that's important, and it's amazing, and I think in our lifetimes, there are some -- some great things to come and some -- some fantastical things to see in terms of what we start learning about working and living in space.    Host:  More dominos starting to fall.    Drew Feustel:   More dominos, more -- more great things to come.    Host:  Alright.    Drew Feustel:   Big time.  Sorry we didn't get to all your...    Host:  No, no...    Drew Feustel:   ...questions.  You got a lot of great information written down here.    Host:  There's a lot of stuff...    Drew Feustel:   I don't know who this is about, but whoever it is laughter has got some interesting things on their plate, yeah.    Host:  Well, believe it or not, you've kind of done some cool stuff being an astronaut and all that, so.    Drew Feustel:   I've had some great opportunities.  You know, we all do.  And -- and that reflects on what I said at the beginning, was I hope that, you know, somehow we inspire the next generation, because, you know, I'm, to -- to be honest, 17 years, going on 18 years in the program, you know, I'm kind of on the backend of my career here, and so I -- I just, you know, you hope that you make a difference so that someone else can come along and continue on that -- that process and -- and just keep us moving forward.    Host:  Alright.    Drew Feustel:   Yeah.    Host:  Thank you very much, Drew!    Drew Feustel:   You're welcome!  My pleasure.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a birthday.  Welcome to the official award-winning podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is Houston, We Have a Podcast, and we just won the Silver Excalibur Award from the Public Relations Society of America just recently.  So yes, we're an award-winning podcast.  Thank you for joining us.  This is episode 52, our annual anniversary.  Because one year ago -- I guess tomorrow -- from the release of this podcast we just started with episode one of Houston, We Have a Podcast, and what a ride it's been.  So we've brought in so many different scientists, engineers, and astronauts to talk about a huge variety of topics and share their incredible stories.  So to celebrate a year of Houston, We Have a Podcast, I brought in the podcast team to go in front of the mics this time.  So today I'm talking with producer, audio engineer, and I like to call audio wizard, Alex Perryman.  And then we're also bringing in Dan Huot, who's been a guest, co-host, and a host for the show.   We'll talk about how the podcast got started and reflect on some of our favorite moments.  So if you're new to the show, this will give you a nice snapshot of some of the conversations we've had so far.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed once again and jump right ahead to our talk with the podcast team of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: All right, guys.  It's been a year.    Alex Perryman:    Host: Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  We got a cake in the middle, it says Houston, we have a birthday.  You're welcome.    Alex Perryman: Thank you, thank you.  Since Dan's not going to say anything, thank you.    Dan Huot: I'm just -- I was just thinking, like, we were so close to starting the podcast on Alex Perryman scholastic achievement day, but we just missed it but, like, a week or so.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Host: Wait is it -- oh, it was last week?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was June 12th.    Host: How did I miss that?  Was I away?    Dan Huot: It was on the work calendar.    Alex Perryman: No, you were here.    Host: I was here, but you thought I wasn't here.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: Okay, I'm sorry.  Happy work achievement day.    Alex Perryman: Thank you.    Host: I should know, I see you, like, multiple times a week.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Yeah, that would be cool.  Well, so today is the one-year anniversary.  One year ago tomorrow, I guess, by the time this releases it will be one year of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  I didn't think that that happened.  We were just kind of doing the podcast, and then next thing you know, a year goes by.  And so I thought this would be a perfect time to get all of us together, the guys that have been doing the podcast since the beginning, and just sort of reminisce and talk about the podcast.  End especially for new listeners this is a perfect opportunity to really get into some of the best moments and really -- if you're just tuning in, this is kind of the highlights, some of the moments that really got us started here.  But, you know, I always say, you know, thanks to producer Alex at the end of the movie or producer Alex, cue the music, you know?  But we don't know anything about producer Alex.  So let's start there.  Who is producer Alex?    Alex Perryman: Well, producer Alex is Alex Perryman.  I went to Full Sail University for audio engineering.  So I come from a music background.  So this is a little different for me.  But audio is audio [Laughs].    Dan Huot: I almost feel like we should caveat Alex has the coolest life ever, so strap in.    Alex Perryman: [Laughs] Yeah, the strap in.  It's not as extravagant as Dan is making it seem.    Dan Huot: Yea, now live up to that.    Alex Perryman: Gary Jordan: Yeah, yeah, thanks, no pressure here.  But I just -- you know, I have some pretty cool friends, know some cool people.    Host: Wow.  Okay, I won't just leave it.  Do you want to talk about who it is or you want to just leave it there and remain --    Alex Perryman: Well, I mean, I do know some Grammy-award winning producers and engineers in the music industry.  So it's kind of cool to have those as your Facebook friends so they can brag all day on Facebook about working with Beyonce here recently, which was what I saw.    Host: What?    Alex Perryman: And so -- yeah [Laughs].    Host: Man, you got the connections.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: So wait, you were into music first, what kind of music were you doing?    Alex Perryman: Any kind.  It didn't really matter as long as it had a beat.    Host: That's really good music, then.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, there you go.    Host: All right.  So what's some of the favorite music that you've actually produced?    Alex Perryman: I do a lot of music for games personally.  So I love doing, like, gaming music and driving music.  Not the, you know, elevator music that will put you to sleep, but the music, like, \"Oh, I'm on a road trip.  It sounds like I'm on a road trip,\" that type of music.    Host: [Laughs] All right.  So Dan added that you have one of the coolest jobs ever; what is it that you're doing here, here at NASA?    Alex Perryman: So here at NASA, outside of being the audio wizard for the podcast, I work with the ISS on a lot of their live in-flight events.  I'm the voice that gets to talk to them at the end of the live event.  So I say my one awesome line and then I sign off.  But it's cool because it's heard in space.  So I get to go bed at night knowing that.    Host: Let's do it here, what's the line?    Alex Perryman: Station, this is Houston ACR.  That concludes the event.     [ Applause ]     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Dan Huot: Literally chills right now.  It might be because the room's 30 degrees.     [ Laughter ]    Host: That is the voice, that's awesome.  So you're constantly -- like, you're doing events, and your voice is in space.  And you have -- I mean, the audio control room, I've been there before, it's awesome.  It's so cool.    Alex Perryman: It's like a spaceship.    Host: It is, you're getting feeds from space all the time.  You actually get to communicate to and from -- well, to space, right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: This concludes the event.  Right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I don't get to communicate from space.  That would be cool, though, if I could go up there and just end the event there, that would be nice.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Just float by the camera, right?    Alex Perryman:  Yeah.    Host: That concludes the event.  [Laughs] All right, Dan, you have been on the podcast.  You were the first guest I had.  We kind of sat down for episode one, and it wasn't -- actually, it wasn't planned to be episode one when we first did it.  It was, like, let's just see how podcasts could go.    Dan Huot: Yeah, we set bar low.    Host: [Laughs] And I was host and you were the guest.  And we talked about the International Space Station and just had a conversation.  And I think it's the most popular episode, I think, to this day.    Dan Huot: That sounds about right.  [Laughs] You know, I remember after we finished walking out and thinking, \"Man, that was so much fun.\"  Because at the end of the day our job is to talk about space.  And that was -- hey, Dan, sit in front of his microphone and talk about space for 45 minutes to an hour and don't shut up the entire time because that's what we actually want.  And that was fantastic.  It was such a blast to do.  And I still don't listen to too many podcasts, but I can tell you making them has been a lot of fun.    Host: Yeah.     [ Music ]  It has been described as one of the greatest engineering feats in human history.    Dan Huot: Not to toot our own horn, but we would certainly -- I would certainly argue that building a football-sized million-pound spacecraft in space is definitely up there.    Host: Yeah.     [ Music ]  Oh, yeah.  I listen to a ridiculous amount of podcasts.  That's actually how it got started, is I moved up to the city and my commute -- well, you know, my commute started when I was really close to here, in Clear Lake to NASA I was 15 minutes.  So that was --    Alex Perryman: Lucky.    Host: Yeah, just -- yeah, right?  Turn on the music or whatever.  It doesn't have to be anything -- I did listen to my own music, but it could be the radio because it's really, really short.  But when your commute goes up to an hour both ways, you know, you need to fill that time.  So I just started listening to podcasts because there's so many of them.  And obviously the first thing you do if you work at the Johnson Space Center is, like, what kind of space podcasts are out there?  So you start looking.  And NASA had a few, but they weren't, like, I don't know, podcasts, right?    Alex Perryman: They were more like shows just put in audio.    Host: Highlight shows almost.  So, like, two-minute recaps.  So I thought -- I was like, \"We should make one.\"  I think the only one at the time was NASA in Silicon Valley.  That was the only true podcast.  Everything else was just, like, highlights or they took space-to-ground and they just took the audio from it, the two-minute highlight show that we do every week.  And I was like, \"I bet you we could do this.\"  So I researched the industry and found out that lots of people listen to podcasts.  Who knew, right?  This industry is enormous.  It's been growing exponentially every single year.  So I thought it was almost prudent for us to enter into that space.  And here we are.  It took us a while to actually get off the ground just because we had to -- we had to build it from scratch and I had to figure out how to do a podcast, how to create weekly content, and how to make sure we did everything right.  Because NASA has a particular way of doing things.   We got to go out through NASA.gov versus any other sort of podcast feed or anything.  But yeah, so that's kind of how it --    Dan Huot: And we had to explain what a podcast was to a lot of people.    Host: Yeah, yeah, that was a huge part of it, was I had to research the industry and come up with statistic and present to management and say, \"We should do this.\"    Dan Huot: But then it was all the fun stuff.  What are we going to call it?  What is it going look like?    Host: [Laughs] What are we going to call it was fun.  Do you remember us coming up with the huge list of names?    Alex Perryman: Oh my gosh.    Host: It was enormous.  And it was actually Kelly Humphreys who came up with Houston, We Have a Podcast.  So props to him.    Dan Huot: Knocked it out of the park.    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: [Multiple speakers] perfect.    Dan Huot: Because coming up with the name, it's almost like you hear it and you're like, \"Dibs, band name,\" because it's so hard to come up with something that just sounds almost natural.  You always do the test, like, \"Hey, did you listen to insert X hear last week?\"  And that was, I think, the first or really the only one that got pitched that it was like, \"Yep, that's it.\"    Host: That's the one [Laughs].    Dan Huot: Lock it down.    Host: Honestly, at that point there was no other options.    Dan Huot: No.    Host: It was just -- it was too perfect.    Dan Huot: Yeah.    Host: And originally to hear.  Well, actually, it was Houston, we've had a problem I think is the original quote.  But we couldn't say we've had a podcast because we have one.  We have one right now.     [ Laughter ]  So we had to do that.  All right, Dan, I want to know a little bit more about your background.  How did you get here to NASA?    Dan Huot: I was poor and I needed money.     [ Laughter ]    Alex Perryman: Join the club.    Dan Huot: No, so that is kind of the genesis of it.  I was in school, I was in college still and my roommate and I were sitting around.  And we had just gotten done with week three of eating hotdogs bought in bulk.  And we were like, \"We should probably try and make some money.\"  So we figured let's go get internships.  And so thankfully I went to school that had a really well-set up student employment program where -- a co-op program where I walked in and was immediately presented with a list of companies.  And they said, \"Pick which ones you want and you'll get an interview.\"  And I was like, \"Oh, that's easy.\"  And NASA was on the list.  And I was a business major in school.  So my first thought was, \"What the heck am I going to do at NASA?\"  I went to school with nothing but engineers.  So I was constantly reminded I am not an engineering.  And so then I saw this and I was like, \"Why would I go to NASA?\"  And they said, \"No, they're just like any other engineering company even where you still have business functions.  You can go do budget and contracts.\"   And that didn't sound super exciting, but it was NASA, so I said, \"Yeah, sign me up.\"  So I interviewed and I got the position.  So I came in as an intern, as a student, and I spent an entire semester in a budget office.  To put it lightly, it was not for me.  I knew that pretty quickly.  But since it was a co-op program that NASA still does -- name drop for the co-op program if you're a student; go apply because it's incredible -- you get to come back for multiple tours.  And they always told us try to get outside your comfort zone, see what else the center has to offer.  And I said, well, I always loved writing.  I liked talking.  Let me go see if I can go do public affairs.  That sounds like fun.  So they brought me in.  It was super intimidating.  They made me do a writing test and, you know, we need to see if you're up to snuff.  Pat's laughing at me.  [Laughs] But I passed.  And I got to come out, and I was a student.  And I mean, I came out, we were still flying Shuttle at the time.   And so I spent a summer in public affairs and it was during -- STS-125 was the first Shuttle mission that I vividly remember.  And that was -- Pat was probably doing commentary.  You were doing Orbit 2.  So that means Pat was one of the people in mission control, you know, giving live in on orbit 2.  So that was the exciting one probably when they were doing space walks and stuff.  So that mission was the last time we fixed Hubble.  And that was the last time we did space walks out of the Shuttle airlock.  So it was a really exciting mission.  There was a big IMAX movie that was made out of it.  I mean, it was incredible.  And that got me hooked.  And then I just kept coming back and refused to leave [Laughs].  And thankfully, they offered me a job by the time I graduated.  So it worked out.    Host: That's true.  That's one of the good things about the co-op program, right, as long as you do refuse to leave, you keep coming back --    Dan Huot: Chances are good.    Host: -- your chances are pretty good.    Dan Huot: That you might be here at NASA.    Alex Perryman: He's got to weigh them down a little bit, it's all right.     [ Laughter ]    Host: You know, that was actually -- that was my thing, too.  I started off as a business major myself.  And I knew pretty early I wanted to do marketing.  So I joined the marketing association.  And I loved films, so I was making a bunch of, like, commercials and stuff for the marketing association.  But I was having sort of a, I don't know, some moment where I was kind of second-guessing myself that maybe marketing wasn't for me.  And so I was thinking about switching to supply chain.  And the career fair was coming up for my sophomore year, and I decided not to go.  So I went to my morning classes.  And it was college, so I went to my morning classes and I was done by, like, 10:30 [Laughs].  I went to home and I changed and just sat on the couch.  And I was watching TV.    Alex Perryman: Very productive.    Host: Very productive, yeah.  I was a good student.    Dan Huot: Career fair, future?  Nah.  TV.    Host: Yeah, right.  And so two of my friend, Nick Penos [assumed spelling] and Chris Walton busted into my door, both suits, and they say, \"Gary, what are you doing?\"  [Laughs] And I go, \"Nothing.  That's what I'm doing.\"  And they said, \"Get your suit on, print out your resume, and come to the career fair.\"  And I was like, \"I don't really want to go.\"  And they said, \"But you're going.\"  And I said, \"Okay, fine.\"    Alex Perryman: Peer pressure.    Host: Yeah, right.  So I went to the career fair.  And they printed out my name, and it said business administration on it because I didn't even declare my major yet because I was only a sophomore.  I had my resume in hand and just everything that I was doing with the Penn State marketing association.  And I circled the career fair.  It was in the Bryce Jordan Center of Penn State, which is just a big -- it's their basketball stadium but it's a stadium and it was completely filled.  It was, like, one of the biggest career fairs.  So I just circled it and that took me an hour.  But I didn't see anything that really stuck out to me except for NASA.  Everything -- you know, because I was already second-guessing what I wanted to do.  But NASA had these banners that had, like, you know, people floating in the microgravity plane and working on robots.  And I was like, \"That looks cool.\"  And I was like, \"Well, I guess I'll just stand in line.\"  So I stood in line and so did a lot of other people.  And I was looking around at their badges and it said aerospace engineer, aerospace engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer.  I'm like, \"I do not belong here.  What am I doing in this line?\"   And I was like, \"What do I have to lose?  I mean, I don't really want to interview with anyone else.\"  So I finally went up to the lady and I was just -- I mean, I had nothing to lose.  I was confident.  I said, \"Here's who I am, here's what I've done.  I make films.  I like marketing.  What do you have for me?\"  And they said, \"Oh, we have a public affairs office that we do -- you know, we make films and we broadcast live.  We write press releases and talk to the public and get them excited about space.\"  And I go, \"That looks fun.\"  So I came down here first semester, Public Affairs Office, sold.  Refused to leave.  Kept coming back [Laughs].  And here I am.  Yeah.    Dan Huot: So I would say shameless plug for Gary: He's responsible for one of the most viewed NASA videos of all time.    Host: Yes [Laughs].  That's right, NASA Johnson Style.     [ Music ]    Host:  NASA Johnson Style.    Host: That was my first co-op video project.  We just, I don't know -- Gangam Style was a hit at the time.  So we were like, \"We can make a parody of this.\"  And so yeah, we went through and I went behind the camera, directed it, edited it, and yeah, made it into this great, fun video.  And people are trying to beat the view count on that ever since.    Dan Huot: I just love we have people launching on rockets, gorgeous views of outer space, stuff you can't get anywhere else, but our best thing is NASA Johnson Style.  Which I think just speaks to the quality of that video, Gary.    Host: Thanks, Dan.  Thanks.  Yeah -- no that was --    Alex Perryman: You really know your audience.    Host: Yeah, I do.  That's what people -- give people what they want, you know?  It was good.  That was really fun.  I love making videos like that.  So that was my thing, as long as I can keep doing fun things.  And, you know, that was another reason I wanted to create the podcast is this is fun.  I get to sit down and have conversations with good people and then you guys, too [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: Thanks.    Dan Huot: Oh, feel the love right there.  My best to you guys.    Host: Yeah -- no, but just really -- I mean, astronauts, engineers.  I mean, just you hear these stories, and they get so passionate about what they're talking about.  And honestly, we can easily make this into a three, four, five-hour podcast episode, but it's just, you know, you got to think about who's listening.  But, I mean, it's just amazing to talk to these people.  So we already started with episode one.    Dan Huot: Well, clearly that was the best.    Host: Clearly that was the best.    Alex Perryman: That was the best.    Dan Huot: And it's been all downhill from there.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Yeah -- no, but that was good.  Because a fun thing about that episode is the first, I think, four minutes of the episode were cut.   Dan Huot: Was terrible.    Host: Because we didn't really know how to start a podcast.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Dan Huot: We tried to be witty.  We're not witty.    Host: Yeah, we tried to be witty and funny, and you're right, it was awful.  So yeah, the first three minutes are cut and we just got right into the good stuff there.  And then we went ever since.  It was pretty awesome.  The next episode was 2017 astronaut class.  I think we selected the class in June, first episode of the podcast came out in July.  So naturally it was just -- it was a hot topic at the time.  Brand new class, 12 new astronauts with great personalities.  And I got 20 minutes with them.  Twenty minutes with 12 astronauts.  So there was no way I was going to be able to interview them.  I mean, if you do the math, I don't even get two minutes with each one of them.  So I was like, \"Okay, I got to do something fun.\"  So we played two truths and a lie.  We played a game.    Alex Perryman: It was awesome.    Host: It was so fun.  And, you know, it was kind of a roll of the dice, too, because you have no idea how they're going to -- you know, they might engage, they might not.  But they were just a fantastic, fantastic group of people and engaged real fast.     [ Music ]    Robb Kulin:  All right.  So inspected a rocket booster while I had liquid oxygen on board.  Skied off the summit of Denali wearing a superman cape.  I went rock climbing with a broken ankle while wear an astronaut helmet.    Host:  Oh.    >> That was the second one?   Robb Kulin:  Skied off the summit of Denali wear a Superman cape.    >> I'll go with that one.    >> Yeah, I'd go with that.    Robb Kulin:  You guys are too easy.     [ Laughter ]    Host: So what kind of cape was it?    Robb Kulin:   That was the lie.    Host: What was the last one again?    Robb Kulin:  I went rock climbing with a broken ankle while wearing an astronaut helmet.    Host: Why?     [ Laughter ]    >> Why not?    Robb Kulin:  I didn't realize it was broken.  I just kept [inaudible].     [ Laughter ]    Robb Kulin:  So one of those padded astronaut helmets like you see in the costume store.  And my buddy's [inaudible] like we go climbing, having some sort of gag with you, whether it be some sort of silly costume, I guess.  And that day it was the astronaut helmet.     [ Music ]    Host: But I got to talk to Anne Roemer, too, on just the selection process and how difficult it is.  Because, you know, I think we in public affairs are partially responsible, but it was really -- it was a large effort.  But we really drove the application process really hard.  And [Laughs] the poor folks that had to go throughout application process --    Alex Perryman: I almost applied.    Host: Really?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I was convinced.  I was like, \"I might can do this.\"     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: I think -- what was it -- 18,000 people applied, which was a record, and 12 got selected.    Host: Twelve.    Dan Huot: Which, when you look at the resumes for those 12 --    Host: It made sense.    Dan Huot: It makes a lot of sense.  [Laughs] It kind of makes you question what you've done with your life because they're just -- overachiever doesn't even start just because they've already done so much and now they're astronauts or now they're going to be restaurants.  It's -- it's insane.  So yeah, getting to play two truths and a lie with them -- that was a treat.    Host: I know.  That's funny.  Yeah, I mean, reading their resumes was insane because we did get to -- and Me and You Shared This was actually interviewing them on Skype before they came.  They were all stationed.  They haven't come to the Johnson Space Center yet to begin all the event.  But we were interviewing them, and it was just fantastic to read through their resumes.  And here I am telling stories about me sitting on the couch and not going to a career fair.  And I'm reading these guys and I'm like, \"My gosh, I really need to go back to school.\"    Dan Huot: That was so much fun, though.  That wasn't a podcast thing.  But as a random aside that was really cool because we got to talk to these people right after they got a phone call everybody wishes they could get in their life.  Like hey, \"Want to come be an astronaut?\"     [ Laughter ]  Let me think about it, no -- yes.  And so we got to talk to those people, you know, within days or a week of them finding out.  That was -- you could feel the emotion.    Alex Perryman: It was nice.  Like, you're smiling, they're smiling.  Everyone's just happy.    Dan Huot: Yeah, we're all just so happy together.     [ Laughter ]  Yeah.    Host: It was really exciting.  And it was well-timed, too.  That was the very next episode, actually, was good timing.  Shane Kimbrough came back.  He had just landed from space.  He flew back and was here the very next day.  And then the very next day after that, I got to interview him about how that landing experience -- so it was, like, as fresh as you could possibly make it for Here and Houston, like, we got to hear him talking about coming down from space.  And I was -- I only got ten minutes, but man, it was --    Alex Perryman: It was a nice ten minutes.    Host: It was, it was really good.     [ Music ]    Shane Kimbrough:  Oh yeah.  No doubt.    Host: How did that feel?    Shane Kimbrough:   I've heard it called, like, a really bad car crash, and now I can confirm that that is accurate.    Host: Wow.    Shane Kimbrough:   So you hit just really hard.  In our case we hit twice really hard.    Host: Oh.  And then you rolled around?    Shane Kimbrough:   And then we rolled some more, too, just for added effects.     [ Music ]    Host: I just -- I felt bad because I had, like, a script of questions that I needed to ask him.    Alex Perryman: You asked him about food.    Host: I asked him about food, of course.  But I forgot to ask him how he was feeling until the very end of my questioning.  I was like, \"Oh my gosh, that should be question number one: Man, how are you doing?  You just came back from space, are you feeling good?\"  But he was, he was talking about he was already back at the gym day two, you know?  Already back and starting to recondition himself.  So just to hear what these guys do.  And, again, I'm on the couch.  You know?  Just saying.  How about you guys?  I mean, I'm just going through episodes one through three, but do you guys have a favorite episode?    Dan Huot: Live from Space.    Host: Oh my -- how did [Laughs].    Dan Huot: We're not all is equally blessed as Alex to where we get to talk to space all the time.  It's kind of a rare occurrence for the rest of humanity.  And so when we got to talk to Jack Fischer, who -- my all-time favorite astronaut --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, that guy's awesome.    Dan Huot: -- we got to talk to him in space, that was pretty surreal.    Host: That was.  And that one was -- we did it live.  The whole thing was live.  We did a video.  So we actually get to see -- we had a special set for the podcast.  And, you know, we had this open air where me and you were kind of telling stories about who he is, and you told the stories the first time you met.  It's just, like, we know he's going to be engaging because he's just in the past has just been incredibly fun to listen to and he comes up with crazy stuff.  And right up front he goes, \"By the way, for every question you ask me, I'm going to switch walls.\"    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: And so if you take snapshots from that episode, every single snapshot will probably be him on a different position, wall, orientation.    Alex Perryman: Just bouncing around like Spiderman.  It was awesome.    Host: It was so fun.     [ Music ]    Jack Fischer:  It's awesome like it is every day.  And what I was going to do just because, you know, it is your first guest from space, every single question I'm going to go on a different, you know, wall.  So I'll be on the walls, I'll be on the ceiling.  I'm going to -- I'm going to adjust orientation mid-interview at every question just because I can and it's cool.     [ Music ]    Host: We got to do it again -- not with you the next time, Dan, but we did it with Megan Sumner and I got to talk to four astronauts.  And that was --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, photography, right?    Host: About photography.  And it was great because all of them were really passionate about that stuff.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Paolo Nespoli actually took the red camera and pointed it outside and he was talking about taking 4K footage of the Earth, which we obviously love.  And then they actually took [Laughs] -- pulled out camera and started taking snapshots just randomly of the event.  But it was just awesome.  They were all fully engaged, all four of them.  It was -- yeah, it was Nespoli, Mark Vande Hei, Joe Acaba, and Randy Bresnik.     [ Music ]    Paolo Nespoli: Yes, so we do have -- for still photography, we essentially have a Nikon camera.  Right now we have several D4.  Each one of us gets his own, plus we have a couple placed strategically.  Some of them are dedicate for special photography like macrophotography.  We need to do a lot of macrophotography for equipment here.     [ Music ]    Alex Perryman: That episode that I really liked was Rocket on a Rocket.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Alex Perryman: Like, I feel like if there's ever an episode that I can quote to people to make myself feel as smart as other people feel that I need to be since I work at NASA, a Rocket on a Rocket is my go-to episode.  Because that's where things clicked like, from, like, you know, the catchy -- oh, it's a rocket on a rocket.  Really, we're talking about launch/abort system.  I was like, \"Oh my gosh, I get it.  I get it.  I can make [inaudible] references, I'm smart.\"    Host: Yeah [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: I love that episode.    Host: Wahab was such a great guest, too.  Because I asked him up front during the podcast, I said, \"You know, I want to call this a rocket on a rocket.\"  I was like, \"Is that fair, is that accurate?\"  He's like, \"You know, when I saw that, when you sent the script to me,\" he's like, \"I thought about it and yes, absolutely.  It is definitely a rocket on a rocket.\"  But it's just so funny because it's, like, his world.  But I don't think he would have called it a rocket on a rocket.  You know, he thinks about the launch/abort.  He's into the intricate details.  But if you pull back, yes, if you're launching on a rocket, this is something that is a rocket that will launch, like, from a speeding rocket.  It's crazy.  That one is -- it was definitely one of my favorite conversations, too because he did such a good job of describing of, like, how it all works.  And you're right.    Alex Perryman: I think that's the reason why it clicked with me so much.  And so I'm, like, walking around, I hear people talking about him like, \"Oh, you're talking about a Rocket on a Rocket?\"  And they're like what?  And I was like, \"Oh, no.  It's fine.\"  I'm right.  It's fine.    Host: Oh, yeah.     [ Music ]    Wahab Alshahin:  When you told me that you were trying to call it a rocket on a rocket, I thought about that, and then I thought about the specifications for what this thing actually does.    Host: Yeah.    Wahab Alshahin:   It's 30 feet tall, it produces 400,000 pounds-plus of thrust.  That is basically -- at that point, yes, that is a rocket that is sitting on top of an even larger rocket.  Yeah.  So certainly that's a fair assessment.     [ Music ]    Host: I think when we first started this, I was kind of -- I was kind of up in the air of how popular it was going to get, you know?  How many people are going to listen to this?  But it just so happened that, you know, like you said, July is when it first came out.  August was when the total eclipse over America --    Alex Perryman: Oh yeah.    Host: -- was coming across.  And that was such a huge event for NASA.  For those of you who don't know, I mean, the total solar eclipse went across the United States and only across the United States, right?  It was only in totality within US territory.  And, like, we just blew it up, right?  We turned it into this huge event.  We went across the country and just sort of did live coverage.  NASA.gov exploded in terms of viewership.  Unmatched viewership.  Like, we totally shattered any record of NASA.gov traffic before that.  It just so happened that Houston, We Have a Podcast was -- had a total solar eclipse episode that was on the front page of NASA.gov whenever the total solar eclipse was coming.  So that gave us a real nice boost.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: And that was a good conversation, too.  I mean, he was an eclipse expert and came with this huge binder of material.  Do you remember that?    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: And he -- like, he actually had a setup right here.  But he turned to the side from the microphone and we gave him another table, and he spread out all of this information because he had so much he wanted to go over.  I barely got a question in because he was like, \"And the next thing I wanted to tell you.\"    Dan Huot: He was prepared.    Host: He was.  That was great.    Alex Perryman: But it was filled with really, really good information, especially the safety information, which was really nice.  I remember friends that listened to that, they were that saying oh, they didn't know they can't just go out there and look at it in normal sunglasses.  It's probably not a good idea.  But listening to the podcast, they can.     [ Music ]    Host: All it.  Let's do it.  However you want to start.    Mark Matney:  Let's talk about safety a little bit.    Host: Okay, safety.    Mark Matney:  Everybody has heard don't look at an eclipse, you'll go blind, right?  We've all heard that.    Host: Yeah.    Mark Matney:  And I remember as a boy puzzling and puzzling over that.  What is it about an eclipse that makes it so dangerous?  Well, is turns out you don't want to stare at the sun ever.     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: Did you guys actually get to see the eclipse, though?  Or were you here in Houston?    Host: I was here in Houston, so I only saw part of it.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I stepped out and I was just like okay.  Because we had -- I had -- we were live.  We were live on air.    Host: You went out, though, didn't you?    Dan Huot: I did.    Host: How was it?    Dan Huot: I abandoned my fellow NASA colleagues and I went to [inaudible].  So I think Houston was about 70% or so?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was pretty decent.    Dan Huot: It looked like -- well, you say that, but you're wrong.     [ Laughter ]  Because it probably got a little bit shady or something maybe.    Host: Actually, no the sky -- I mean, if you really paid attention maybe.  But, like, it looked pretty much the same.    Alex Perryman: I only saw it for, like, 20 seconds and I had to run back upstairs.    Host: Well, I put on my glasses and I could tell.  But, like, you know, the sky kind of looked the same to me.    Dan Huot: So I went on a trip to the middle of nowhere in Kentucky.  And this is going to be kind of a long aside, but I think it's worth it because if you have the chance to see a total solar eclipse, drop what you're doing and go somewhere where you can watch it.  Because, I mean, I've seen rocket launches, I've seen Soyuz landings, you know, all this crazy stuff -- that was one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my entire life.    Host: Wow.    Dan Huot: I went with a group of friends out to the middle of nowhere.  I got a bunch of really nerdy friends who calculated, you know, exactly where it will have the longest viewing point and they narrowed it down using maps to this cornfield in this, you know, very small town in Kentucky.  And we showed up and a guy had already rented out a farmer's cornfield, gave the farmer $1,000 and didn't let anybody else come on the cornfield with him.  So we were right across the street in somebody's front yard.  But it's this really surreal experience where it -- colors start to change all around you.  And this is -- it gets a little bit darker and a little bit darker.  And there's this moment where all of the bugs -- you didn't realize but there's bugs and there's just noise and everything -- it all just went completely silent.  And it was totally eerie and kind of freaky.  And then when it actually goes into totality and you can finally take the glasses off and just stare at the sun safely, it's -- it's weird.   It's weird.  It's really hard to describe, but it's -- it's a totally cool moment.  It's a primal moment where you almost automatically start thinking, you know, what did people hundreds and thousands of years ago that this happened, look up at the sky and think the world was ending?  Because you almost get that feeling.  Like, this should not be happening.     [ Laughter ]  And then it lasts a couple of minutes.  And then it's done.  And we have another one coming up in 2024, I think?    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: That's going to actually come through Houston, isn't it?    Host: I think it's more Austin, San Antonio.    Dan Huot: It will come through Texas, but it will come across the US again.  So anybody listening, start making plans for 2024.  Go out and see the total solar eclipse, you will not regret it.    Host: And I think that one's suppose to be longer totality.  I think yours was only, like, two minutes; I think this one's, like, four -- close to four or something.    Dan Huot: So it will be twice as cool.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  That just sounds surreal.  I think that was one of the stories was, like, two armies were, like, about to battle, and then a total solar -- this is, like, hundreds of years ago.  I'm going to butcher this story, by the way, because I don't really know all the details.    Dan Huot: Just start making up random fantastical stuff.    Host: Yeah.  But so total solar eclipse happened.  And they kind of looked up, the total solar eclipse passed, and they canceled the battle.  Like, \"Oh, that's a sign.  We're not going to fight today.\"  I wish I knew more information about that story.  But yeah -- no, it sounds surreal.    Dan Huot: This story brought to you by Garypedia.    Host: Yeah [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: I love it.    Host: So the very next -- the very next one after eclipse, this one was fun, was when Styx came.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Yeah.  They were on tour and they had a free day.  So we coordinated to bring them here on site.  And I helped out with the tour just like we do for many VIP tours.  But they actually sat down and we had a conversation.  And that was definitely one of my favorite conversations.  Because we just brought two members of Styx and then two I'll call them exploration experts.  Like, they actually study what it takes to go explore the cosmos.  And we talked about just that, you know?  So if we were to land on Mars, what kind of things will we need or the -- Styx was asking questions.  They were fully engaged.  We were talking about going to Mars, we talked about going out to Pluto and selfishly to the moon of Pluto, Styx.  You know?  Like, what would that even look like?  Just like these -- these kind of weird concepts of yeah, so if we did go out to the sort of Kuiper Belt are, like, what would a human mission kind of look like?   The answer would be very difficult.  But yeah, we had the experts there and actually had a fantastic conversation.    Alex Perryman: I ended up getting a guitar pick --    Host: Really?    Alex Perryman: -- as a gift.  And that was exciting.  I still have it.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Really?  That's so great.  Yeah, that was -- that was definitely one of my favorite episode for sure.  Because we sat -- it was different because we have -- right now we're kind of in a -- it's the three of us, right?  And we have this circular stables we have mics at three of us.  But this one we just sort of sat and you set up some booms, like, around.  And we just sat in a circle.    Alex Perryman: It was six people.    Host: Yeah, six people, right?  And we sat in a circle and just had a conversation.  And it was awesome.  We got another one coming up soon here where we're going to do that again.  But yeah, I mean, I love that kind of -- where everyone can just chime in.  Because you can tell it was kind of a rocky start because everyone's just kind of like, \"What is this going to look like?\"  And then eventually I couldn't get anyone to shut up, you know?  So it was great.     [ Music ]     [ Inaudible ]    Tommy Shaw:  If you were going to vacation and you were in the area, you'd go to Pluto and you'd take some snapshots.    Host: Yeah, see it from the surface.    Lawrence Gowan:  I don't know, I think with a little work, we could buff it up and make it a holiday destination.    Tommy Shaw:  It's a fixer-upper.  There's no doubt about it.    Lawrence Gowan:  Handyman's dream.    John Connolly:  It's about the size of downtown, Chicago, by the way.    Lawrence Gowan:  Is it?    Glenn Lutz: Yeah, it's not too big.    John Connolly:  Yeah, it's not that big.    Lawrence Gowan:  Chicago's nice.  [Laughs]    John Connolly:  Yeah, yeah.    Glenn Lutz:  A frozen Chicago.     [ Multiple Speakers ]     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: Did you guys do an episode during Harvey?    Alex Perryman: Gary did, yeah.    Host: So [Laughs] it was funny -- well, I wouldn't say funny because I couldn't get here.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Me, either.  I was in Dallas.    Host: Yeah, NASA was straight up closed.  And I live right off of Buffalo Bayou.  So when Harvey hit, it's kind of this river and all the floodgates dump into this river.  And so the floodgates got filled up.  So they let them loose on Buffalo Bayou.  And the whole thing flooded to levels I've never seen.  It's flooded once before since I've lived there, but not to this level.  And so the road that I usually take to get to NASA was completely under water.  So I wasn't going anywhere.  At that time, I mean, it wasn't long that we had started the podcast.  It was only, like, two months or something.  But was like -- I think it's appropriate to say something about it because just to acknowledge that this is happening.  So a couple days afterwards the levels started going down and people were kind of all over the streets just checking out the area because everything had been under water for two, three straight days.  And so I just kind of recorded, like, an update, just like, \"Here's what happened, guys.  A lot of things happened.  People lost their lives within Houston.   And, you know, a lot of people were affected, especially, you know, homes in one way or another,\" and just sort of just acknowledge that.  But I went out with a -- I had a portable audio recorder, my own personal one.  And I just recorded -- I wrote a script and printed out an update.  I mean, it was really hard to work, you know?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: Just because everyone was out of commission pretty much.  But I figured this was the right thing to do.  So I actually walked across the bridge to Buffalo Bayou and I recorded it on the bridge.  I was right -- and the water was right underneath me.  And the sidewalks -- where it was supposed to be the sidewalks were completely under water right next to me but I was on the bridge.  And I recorded it right there on Buffalo Bayou, so I recorded it outside.  But it was just, like, a two-minute update.  But I could successfully say that we never missed a week.    Alex Perryman: We did not, not even for a hurricane.    Host: That's right, we never missed a week.  That was crazy.     [ Music ]    Host: But if there's one good thing that came out of this disaster, it's learning that Houston is full of some incredible people and spaceship Earth is not such a bad place to live.  Local first responders and Coast Guard were helping those in need, and even Texas civilians grabbed their trucks and boats to aid in these efforts.  At NASA's Johnson Space Center's flight controllers braved the weather and camped out in mission control 24/7 to made sure the crew members aboard the International Space Station were safe and well.     [ Music ]  I think another thing was, you know, we had a lot of the changes just throughout the whole -- the whole time that we were here for a year.  We had -- first we were in Studio B, remember that?    Alex Perryman: Yes, the other studio.    Host: And the podcast setup was interesting.    Dan Huot: Where it was warmer.    Alex Perryman: It was warmer, but it was louder.    Host: But, you know, because we had never started a podcast before, we had very limited equipment.  We have these mics.  But actually, I can see the table right now.  It's this really small wooden table.  And we just clamped the mics to the side of that table.  There's barely enough room for two pieces of paper.  And we had our conversations in the back of Studio B because it was next to some sound buffers or something.  But I think we did a couple episodes there and they turned out okay, but the fan --    Alex Perryman: It just got ridiculous.    Host: Yeah, it got ridiculous.    Alex Perryman: The summer and it was trying to cool everything off.    Host: Yeah, I mean, it started getting a little bit annoying.    Alex Perryman:  It would just kick on randomly and it's like, \"Well, I hope we're done with this episode.\"     [ Laughter ]    Host: So that's -- that's when we went so the sound booth.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was a little bit warmer, cozy.    Dan Huot: Cozy's the operative word.    Host: You did a couple in there.    Dan Huot: Yeah, I did a couple in there, which I didn't mind it too much.  But I don't know if it's just me, but you almost start to get uncomfortable when you're in a sound booth after a while.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it's just -- because it's totally quiet.    Dan Huot: It's too quiet.    Host: Yeah.  I mean, the levels are great, but the way our sound booth is situated, you got this big desk at the corner, right?  And we have interpreters sit there and they're looking at the screen And they have all their papers out.  It makes sense.  But for a conversation where you have to turn your head for the whole -- I mean, the mic is over here, you have to turn your head, I mean, the sound was bouncing everywhere.    Alex Perryman: There's a giant window.    Host: It was already pretty tight.  So now we're doing it in Studio A. And I want to bigger table.  This is a nice table right higher.    Alex Perryman: We're getting there.  We're slowly moving up.  It's a little cold in here, but it will even out.    Host: That's why for all of our guest now whenever we invite them, I'm like, \"Bring a jacket.\"     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: Trust me.    Host: But it's July.  I was like, \"Bring a jacket.\"    Alex Perryman: You'll want a jacket.  And you'll want July heat when you leave out of here.    Host: Oh.  Dan, do you have any guests that sort of stick out whenever you think about the folks that you've actually sat down and you've interviewed?    Dan Huot: A couple.    Host: Yeah?    Dan Huot: Probably the three most recent ones -- well, three of the most recent ones that I did which were in the booth.  I got to talk to Drew and Ricky before their flights.  And those were really cool.  Drew has this crazy, elaborate, reaching back to the early 1900 story of how he got to where he got.  And that was really cool to hear.  And then Ricky Arnold has taught in schools all over the planet and just shared his experience of what it was like getting off the plane for the first time in Morocco as a 20-something and just being --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, international band.    Dan Huot: Yeah, totally fish out of water in all these different places.  It's always cool to talk to an astronaut.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dan Huot: Because they all have these super diverse, super unique backgrounds.  They'll have some of the same resume things, like, a lot of them are pilots or something.  But just the path that they took to become that is always unique.  And it kind of helps you realize, you know, no matter where you're starting, this is where you can end up.    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: Right.    Dan Huot: The other one I really liked was I talked to Scott Smith, the nutritionist.  And as somebody who as horrendous diet [Laughs] you never really think about just all of the different aspects of your health that what -- the food that you're putting into your body can affect.  And just the level of what they're tracking for the astronauts in space is unreal, that they're able to track all of these individual aspects of the food just to keep the crew members healthy.  And then the stuff he was talking about for the vision changes is really cool.  Because vision changes, for anybody that kind of follows along, that's one of the big kind of gremlins out there for what happens to humans in space that we have to solve before we, you know, send people on to Mars for three years.  And there's a lot of theories out there about why it's happening, but they've actually been finding this genetic reason that could potentially, you know, give us an advance warning that hey, you might be susceptible to this.   And it will have effects for people here on Earth because it's linked to another disease.  And all this crazy stuff.  And coming in, like, his title is he's a bio -- bio what is it?  Biochemical nutritionist or something.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Dan Huot: Something of that nature.  You wouldn't normally expect from the title to sit there and learn about that, but that's what he's working on.    Host: Right.    Dan Huot: And that was eye-opening.    [00:47:40] [ Music ]    Scott Smith:  Changes in some of their hormones.  There's a list of about eight or nine things that we had that we found a clinical population that had the exact same set of characteristics.  And that is women with polycystic ovary syndrome.    Dan Huot: Really?    Scott Smith:  Really.  Polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS as they call it is the leading cause of infertility in women.  It affects 10% to 20% of women which is a staggering incidence.     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: I'm jealous, though, you got to talk to Ginger.    Alex Perryman: Ginger is awesome.    Dan Huot: And Ginger is one of the coolest people on the face of the planet.    Host: You know, I mean, it would be a totally different story, but Alex and I were talking afterwards after we recorded that episode.  That was part of the Women's History Month episodes.  She was one of our four guests.  And I kind of wish we just -- the podcast, her segment was the 20 minutes, 25 minutes we spent after the podcast.    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: She was just -- first of all, her story -- I wish I included both, how about that?  Because her story was just incredible.  Just a roller coaster of emotion and start to finish, just incredible.  But oh yeah, afterwards it was so great because we put down -- we turned off the recording, right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: And Ginger had actually attended because I say it's cold, but it's an audio podcast.  I was like, \"There's no specific attire.\"  She came in gym clothes.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.  She went straight to gym afterwards.    Host: She's like, \"I'm going to the gym right after this.  So this makes the most sense.\"  But we were just chatting and we were talking about -- like, she got an email notification while we were chatting, right?  And it was for a concert that was coming up.  And she's like, \"I really want to go to this concert.\"  And so she start texting her friend, \"Do you want to go with me?\"  And next thing you know, she's pulling up and she's buying tickets, right?    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: And then she's like, \"Have you heard of this artist before?\"  Like, I don't think -- and she's like, \"Oh, I love it.\"  And then she puts down her phone and we just start jamming for a couple minutes.    Alex Perryman: It's the best.    Host: It was great.    Alex Perryman: I was so mad I turned the recorder off.  I was like, \"I can't believe I did that.\"  I never turn it off when, like, normally I just keep it rolling and it's like I'll have buffer room at the end.  But I cut it off, and I don't know what I was thinking.    Dan Huot: Yeah.  She's one of the most, like, objectively cool people that you'll ever meet in your life.  But she's also insanely driven, insanely intelligent.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dan Huot: And capable and was a flight director and all this crazy stuff.    Host: Yeah.    Dan Huot: And then she could sit there and introduce you to cool new bands.    Host: Yeah [Laughs].  Just super personable.  But yeah, her story was great.  And she never gave up.  She always just pushed forward.  It was an amazing story to hear.    Dan Huot: Go listen to Ginger's episode.    Host: Yeah.  That one was good, Stories of Her Strength is the name of the episode.    Alex Perryman:  Yes.     [ Music ]    Host:  Was it this goal that you had in the back of your mind that really helped you to kind of excel?  Because you graduated in the second of your class in high school, right?    Ginger Kerrick:   Yes, yes.  By one one thousandth of a point, not that I carry that with me to this day.  But --     [ Music ]    Host: You know, you were talking about Scott Smith, how -- you know, just learning his perspective and you're thinking about your own diet whenever you're thinking about nutrition.  And that was the same thing that happened whenever we had Andrea Hanson in here to talk about exercise.  That was a good one.  She talked about what the astronauts have to do to exercise and why they exercise, really to mitigate some of the bone and muscle loss that they have.  But I asked her, I was like, \"What do you take out of this?  Being a person, an expert, what are you taking out of this?\"  And she goes, \"Actually, because the folks on the ground are helping the astronauts so much, I have actually -- I actually have my own personal trainer because I realize how important that is.\"  It was an interesting perspective.  Because I was like, \"Huh, I wouldn't have thought that.\"  I thought it would have been a technique or a routine.  But it's, like, the whole personal trainer aspect.  She's like, \"I get that now.\"    Alex Perryman: That makes sense.    Host: Yeah, that makes sense to me.     [ Music ]    Andrea Hanson:  And so one thing I've taken away is I do hire a trainer to help me work out so that I'm make sure that I'm pushing myself and somebody's there to help keep me motivated along the way.     [ Music ]    Host: Poor Andrea, though, because that was the one where Greg -- oh my gosh.    Alex Perryman: The one time I take a vacation.    Host: Yeah, Alex took a vacation.  Where were you going?  You were actually speaking.    Alex Perryman: I was speaking at Full Sail University.  So I was -- I was down there for Hall of Fame Week.  And I got a lovely email from Greg [Laughs] explaining to me don't panic, I've handled it, but we're going to have to rerecord this podcast [inaudible].  We don't do that.  I mean, it's not live, but we get one take.    Host: But yeah -- no, that was -- the file came in corrupt the way that it was recorded.  That was another one we did in the sound booth.  And I felt so bad.  I was like, \"Andrea,\" I was like, \"You did a great job.\"    Alex Perryman: The odds of that happening are so slim.    Host: I know.    Dan Huot: You did so great, now come do it again.     [ Laughter ]    Host: So we had to rerecord the whole thing.  And she had no problems at all.  She was like, \"I understand, absolutely, thank you for coming.\"  She was really, really cool about it.    Alex Perryman: That's awesome.    Host: But that's not the only time that we've had a close call.  While that one was not even a close call, Greg just --    Dan Huot: That was a call.    Host: That was a call.    Alex Perryman: It was a call.  Close call was episodes being deleted that weren't released yet, close call.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Alex Perryman: That was --    Dan Huot: Who did that?  Gary.    Alex Perryman: Gary's like, \"Don't look at me.\"    Host: Don't look at me, I don't touch that.  Although I did have to record one episode.  I'll get to that after this story.    Alex Perryman: But yeah, so John was using our recorder for something.  And he reformatted the recorder.  I didn't know that he was going to reformat the recorder because we had just recorded an episode the day before and he wanted to use the recorder the next morning.  And I was like, \"Oh, that's fine.  I'll just pull the episodes off.\"  He's just going to record something.  I marked my numbers, I know where it's at.  I get the recorder back and I'm, like, \"Hey, John, did you pull everything?  Because there's nothing on it.\"  He's like, \"No, no, I reformatted it.\"  I was like, \"Oh.  Oh no.\"    Dan Huot: Oh, no.    Alex Perryman: And so I went panicking and it was -- I think it was, like, game two of NBA playoffs.  Throughout the entire game I literally have the recorder to some program trying to recover files.  And it took the entire game -- the entire Rockets game for it to find the files.  And it found them and I got the files back.  I'm still amazed that it happened.  I'm pretty sure that's where audio wizard comes from because that was pure magic.    Host: Yep, that is where it comes from.    Alex Perryman: The fact that every single file that we've ever record on there came back.  And that's hundreds of files.  And so I'm just, you know, I'm glad that software was there.  I would never like to go through that experience again.  I didn't know how to tell Gary.  Like, I was just sitting there because we recorded another episode, and I didn't want to tell him before the episode.  So I'm just sitting there look at him like, \"I am so sorry.\"    Dan Huot: Great job.  By the way, everything you did last week is completely gone.  Bye.    Host: Okay, bye.  Yeah, right?    Alex Perryman: I was like, \"Don't worry, I got a plan.  Hopefully this will work.\"    Host: Oh, actually, I don't think you told me until after you recovered them.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, that's right.  I did not tell him until after I recovered it.    Host: That was a smart move to do.    Alex Perryman: I just waited.  I was like, \"But I have the files now.  Don't worry [Laughs].\"    Host: That was the strategy I did with my mom whenever I went skydiving the first time.    Alex Perryman: There you go.    Host: I went skydiving, I went on the ground, and then I called my mom.  I was like, \"Mom, I went skydiving.\"  She's like, \"You did what?\"     [ Laughter ]  I was like, \"But I'm on the ground now, so you can't yell at me.\"  She's like, \"Oh, but I will.\"     [ Multiple Speakers ]  Some of the other folks that we have now.  So first of all, the shout-out to -- even though Greg lost that episode [Laughs] shout out --    Dan Huot: Not holding any grudges.    Host: Yeah, not holding any grudges, I definitely have forgiven him.  But he made the music for Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And that's great music.  The intro stuff?    Dan Huot: Oh, yeah.    Host: With the splashes of actual historical audio from missions -- really, really cool.  One small step for man, you know, he's got all that in there.  It's great.  Matt McKenzie, who actually was an intern for me back, oh my gosh, I think almost two years ago at this point.    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: It was two years ago.  Made the thumbnail.  So I'd like to thank him for that for sure.  And, you know, you were talking to Pat earlier.  Pat's off here to the side.  He's one of our new producers for Houston, We Have a Podcast, as well as Bill Stafford, who actually does all of the posting and --    Dan Huot: Click, click, click.    Host: Yeah, all that clicking.    Dan Huot: Taking awkward pictures of us [Laughs].    Host: So I'd like to thank them for joining the team.  Because for the longest time, I mean, Alex, it was pretty much just me and you just kind of running the show.    Alex Perryman: Yep.    Host: That was -- that was tough.  But yeah, here we are, 52 episodes later and a lot more to come.    Dan Huot: Pretty soon we'll get Pat to host one.    Host: That's right, the golden voice.    Dan Huot: Get that golden radio voice.    Host: Golden radio voice.    Dan Huot: Back out on the airwaves where it belongs.    Host: Yeah.     [ Laughter ]    >> Thank you.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Golden voice, everybody.  All right.  I'm going to open this.  It's probably going to make a lot of noise.  While we're doing that, I wanted to tell everyone that a lot of the episodes that we did throughout our 52 episodes were suggestions from you.    Alex Perryman: Yep.    Host: One of my favorites, actually, was spacesuits.  Someone suggested spacesuits, and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, of course we have to have a spacesuits episode.\"  So we brought on Les Padilla, hardware manager for the EMU, which is the suit they have up on the Space Station right now.  That's the one they actually go outside the Space Station and work outside in.  And we just had a chat about what spacesuits are all about.  So if you like the show, please give us suggestions on what you would like to listen to and we will actually pay attention to those.  The way I've been doing it is you have to type in Houston, We Have a Podcast to, like, Twitter or Facebook or something because that's what I do.  I just kind of, like, search that within the social media platform.  Like, \"Oh, that's a really good idea.\"  What was the other one we did?  BEAM.    Alex Perryman: BEAM, yeah.    Host: BEAM was another suggestion.  I was like, \"Oh yeah, we should totally do one on BEAM.\"  Because at the time the actual studies had sort of wrapped up.  And now it's there as, like, a storage unit on the Space Station.  So that one's pretty cool.  And then also, this one would actually be really helpful for us, too, is rate us.  Five stars would be preferred.  But, you know, whatever you think.  If you really enjoy the podcast, that actually helps us say to our managers, \"Hey, look, people really like this and we should continue to do it.\"  So please leave some stars and then any comments you have for us, both praise and anything critical.  Because we will pay attention to that and kind of fix it along the way.  Have we?  I think we've made a couple fixes.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, the room change was one of them.    Host: The room change was definitely one of them, yeah, and the mic.  And we actually have a -- we have a third mic right now, and we're hopefully going to get some more.  But yeah, if you want to see more, like, video episodes or if you want to do --    Dan Huot: Yeah, those would be fun.    Host: Longer, shorter, if you have a topic, you know, just leave them there.  And I'll end by saying thank you to Alex for sticking with me the whole time and dealing with all of my stuff.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Dan Huot: Yay.    Host: All of my nagging, \"Hey, did you send the transcription yet?  Hey, when is this going to be edited?  Hey, can I get -- \" yeah, so anyway.    Alex Perryman: I just need to edit this.  It's 2.5 seconds right here and we should be good.  We should be good.    Host: And for Dan because I can't do this all by myself.  So thank you for coming on and hosting and being a part of it and helping to get it off the ground.    Dan Huot: I mean, I do the easy stuff.  So.     [ Laughter ]  No, I would thank you guys because you built this from scratch.  And now we're 52 episodes in.  And we have a cake.  So you did a really good.    Host: Awesome.    Alex Perryman: Thank you.    Host: Cool.  All right, I think we'll end there.  And oh yeah.  Well, okay, the final thank you is to you, the listener.  Thank you for tuning in.  Thank you for subscribing.  Thank you for listening to our show and keeping us going and giving us feedback so that we can continue to do this.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Host: Yay.     [ Whistles ]     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: Cake.    Alex Perryman: You can press the red button now, Pat.     [ Music ]     Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  We had a lot of the fun recording this annual episode -- well, the one-year birthday episode of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And I'm glad I got to sit with my team.  And really, thanks to Alex for sticking with me through the whole thing and dealing with all of my crap.  She's sitting right next to me [Laughs], constantly bugging her every single week.  \"Hey, is the transcript ready?  Hey, is the episode ready?\"  So it's been quite a ride.  And then Dan just helping out from start to finish, just making sure that it's successful all the way through.  So also one thing I forgot to mention during the episode was a huge thanks to NASA in Silicon Valley podcast for our friends over at Ames.  Whenever we were starting the podcast, I kind of didn't really understand fully how to do it the NASA way, and they already had their established.   So I was actually talking with Matt Buffington and Jerry Colon, some of those guys out there to understand just how do you do this?  And they were very helpful along the way.  So thanks, guys, if you're listening.  Really appreciate your help.  You can go listen to them.  That's NASA in Silicon Valley.  Otherwise you can listen to Gravity Assist.  That's our other NASA podcast out at headquarters.  And hopefully we'll have a couple more coming because I'm really digging the whole podcast scene here at NASA.  So otherwise you can go to NASA.gov/ISS to get the latest information on the International Space Station.  If you've noticed through all of our 52 episodes, a lot of them have been directly related to some of the research and the people, actually, that actually go and work on the International Space Station.  So you can learn a lot there.  We are still taking #AskNASA questions.  So use that hashtag and then just make sure to mention Houston, We Have a Podcast and we'll bring your questions or ideas right on the show.   We even said, you know, the spacesuit episode and the BEAM episode.  There's been a couple others, too, that were directly influenced -- space medicine, the one with Natasha Chough, astronaut health, that was another one.  Hey, I want to learn what a flight surgeon does.  We're like, \"Okay, let's bring her on.\"  So yeah, all of these were suggestions from you guys, the listeners that we brought right on the show.  So just make sure to mention Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And we'll make more episodes.  I mean, we do this every week.  So the more you give us, the more we can do.  Really appreciate you guys listening, too.  It really means a lot to us to help us to keep going.  So this birthday episode was recorded on June 20th, 2018.  Thanks to Kelly Humphries, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford.  Pat and Bill we actually had in the room with us during the recording.  They're essential to the group right now.  And also Greg Wiseman, who has also been helping out.  You know, when the audio wizard is not here, Greg come.  And he's just Greg.  We have audio wizard and Greg.  Thanks always to Alex Perryman and Dan Hewitt.  And then thanks to you for listening and helping with the success of the podcast.  That helps us to keep going.  We'll be back with a brand new episode next week."

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 218, “Eye to the Earth.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. If you're like me, you follow pretty much every astronaut on social media. And you know that when they're on board the International Space Station they like to spend time in the Cupola, the bay window that looks down at the Earth, and they share photos of incredibly beautiful parts of the planet. You might think that they're the lucky few who get to take such pictures, but there's actually a way where middle school students can get their own photos taken from station. This is part of the Sally Ride EarthKAM, or Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle school students, program. Students pick a place on the planet of their choosing and a simple set up on the space station will take the photo for them. They learn about space, geography, social science and more. On this episode, we're going to dive deep into this program with the vice president of education at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, Dr. Kay Taylor. So, let's get right into it. Enjoy.   [ Music]  Host: Kay Taylor, thanks so much for coming on Houston We have a Podcast today.  Kay Taylor: Thanks a lot for having me.  Host: I'm excited to talk about EarthKAM. This has been a program that I have been aware of but haven't really dove too deep into what it is and how it started, and so I'm excited to be talking to you today. But before we get into EarthKAM, I want to learn a little bit more about you: what it takes to be the person running this thing. So, Kay, tell me a little bit about yourself.  Kay Taylor: I've been at the, the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, I guess this is now my seventh year. Before that I had a career in journalism in mass communication, and I taught at the collegiate level for many years. But was a native of North Alabama, and it's interesting, I kind of thought everyone grew up sitting around the table talking about NASA missions growing up, and I discovered that, that's not the case. I am, I was born and raised in, in north Alabama. My dad worked at NASA. My mom was a teacher for many, many years. And NASA was always just sort of in the conversation. And as I went away and pursued my own career, always kept up with, with north Alabama, and particularly Huntsville, and, and NASA. And moved back to the area when my parents were a little older and, and needed a bit of assistance. And came to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in a communications capacity, and, and then moved into the role of education. And shortly after I moved into education, NASA presented the opportunity that, that they were going to be continuing this amazing program that I had heard about called the Sally Ride EarthKAM. And what EarthKAM was, and still is today, is this amazing STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) experience aimed at middle school students, but really open to all secondary education classrooms, to take part in live science on the International Space Station. And so, the rocket center was, was very excited when NASA let us continue the work that, that literally was begun by Dr. Sally Ride of, America's first woman in space, in, in 2016. And we've been, we’ve been going along and we're in our, we're in our second period of performance with the program, and we're continuing to reach students, not only across the country, but around the world.  Host: That's fantastic. And that's really what I wanted to get into today Kay, is, is what this is, and really how it's expanded to involve more and more people. You know I think growing up in the -- you said northern Alabama, I believe that's the Huntsville area; I want to get a sense because, to be honest, a lot of my guests are from Houston and I'm very familiar with, with what it's like here, it's very much the same. We have astronauts as neighbors, which is pretty cool. And it's, you know, it's an interesting place to grow up, and we have something, you know, like the NASA Johnson Space Center right in our backyard, and it's, it's very interesting. I wonder, when you talk about NASA was always a part of the conversation, I wonder, I wonder what that was like: can you paint a picture of just, how it was, you know, what led to your belief that this was a much larger, much widely known thing in the northern Alabama area?  Kay Taylor: Well at, it was just, it was our, it was the daily experience, of my dad would come in and, and he would be talking about you know the latest, latest, latest developments in the STS (Space Transportation System) program or came home and he said, you know, we're going to build this giant telescope; it's called Hubble. He was in the, he was in the business administration side of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center here. But we were just always talking about, you know, what the next big achievements for NASA were going to be. And I remember, you know, he, he kept me out of school when the, when the first, when the first orbiter made one of those famous 747 piggyback flights, they flew it into Huntsville so that they could test it at Marshall. And you know, we, we stood on one of the roofs of the buildings and, and watched that, you know, watched that orbiter come across, come across Marshall Space Flight Center. And I just assumed everyone was talking about it. But, but that was, you know, that was often not the case. And I think that maybe was one of the things that so attracted me to the, to the position here at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center is that the rocket center functions as the visitor center for Marshall Space Flight Center. It is our job to tell the story of Marshall Space Flight Center, and the story of space exploration. So, for me, it was just a way to, to bring what I grew up with and what I continue to keep up with, and hopefully use some of my communication skills, some of my education skills to, to make that story more widely known. And the U.S. Space and Rocket Center here in Huntsville is truly, it's truly the front porch of Huntsville, Alabama. It is, it is where NASA's story unfolds, it's where we tell the story of propulsion, it's where we tell the story of advances in spaceflight and where we're going. It's the home of Space Camp where, you know, each year thousands upon thousands of, of students come through and they, they learn about space exploration, they learn about our roots in space exploration, and then they, they kind of chart their own course from there.  Host: See, that's one thing I always am so jealous of, Kay, is when I hear these stories of, of Space Camp. I just, maybe it was my lack of my own understanding. I grew up in the Pennsylvania area and so, maybe it was just something that wasn't, wasn't close enough, right? But it's just, it sounds like a gateway, the way you describe it is perfect to, to understand more and get, get engaged with and maybe even dedicate a career to spaceflight. And that's wonderful. And you mentioned in the beginning, Kay, when you were talking about your path that led you to where you are, you talk about this program and that's really the basis of our conversation today, is this EarthKAM program. And you prefaced it with Sally Ride. You called it the Sally Ride EarthKAM. Just who is Sally Ride, and why, why is this program named after her?  Kay Taylor: Sally Ride. Sally Ride was America's first woman in space. She was, she was an accomplished astronaut, she was a fantastic scientist, she was such an ambassador for the American space program, post-Apollo generation. I think, I think Sally embodied where space exploration quickly was headed: expanded opportunity, expanded horizons. And it was actually Dr. Ride who, who proposed the, this original program, which began as a program that was called KidSat. And she, she knew that from her own experiences in space that viewing the Earth from space often changed the astronaut’s perspective of the Earth. That suddenly, you know, you're above the Earth and you look down and there's this almost fragile-looking marble that contains all of life. And, and you know, many astronauts have commented on how that change in viewpoint, that change in, in altitude, if you will, changed, changed their way of seeing the Earth. And she thought, what an amazing tool; if, if we could allow students to have kind of a similar experience to that, what if we allowed students to choose how they view the Earth? And so, she was incredibly gifted, analytical mind. She said, well let's think about this. What if we, what if we were to put a camera on the shuttle, and then as it transitioned to the, to the ISS, put a camera in space, and allow students to select where that camera photographs an image based upon where the shuttle or the ISS was passing over in orbit? And it's, it's a very straightforward concept. It took a little bit of engineering to develop the protocols that would allow students on Earth to create a digital file to upload to the ISS to control a Nikon camera aboard the International Space Station. But of course, because it's NASA it all sounds easy. But it was such a straightforward concept. And so, as I mentioned, it tested as prototype on the shuttle. But it launched on the ISS in, in 2001. And since then, being hosted through UC (University of California) San Diego at Sally Ride Science, and then later coming to us, over a million images have been requested by school children from around the globe. We've had over a million students take part in our mission weeks through, through EarthKAM. We, you know, we're anticipating two missions in the fall, coming up. And when I say missions, because it does require some crew time, because it does require assets on board the ISS, we run targeted mission weeks, typically four to five a year, and in that mission week students from around the world can, can log in and determine the orbit of the ISS, where it's passing over, and select when they would like the shutter on the camera to click, thus capturing their image of a particular geographic location. So, over the lifespan of this program we've had students from, I believe every state and over 60 countries who have done, who have done just that: logged in, studied the latitude and longitude of the orbits as the, as the ISS passed over, and determined where to operate that camera. And then through the engineering genius of, of NASA and, and the Sally Ride program, the student then receives back the image, which are held in a database. And the student can go back and find their image and know that for a moment they operated a scientific instrument aboard the International Space Station. And as we, as we are struggling through COVID and the, and the incredible, incredible tensions that our schoolteachers and our students are facing in the, the stretching of resources, the great thing about this program is there's no cost associated with it. And a teacher can sign up and, and the students can take more than one image. So, it's really, it's a great way to, to bring science into classrooms, and, and it's at no cost to the school districts.  Host: So, it sounds like, Kay, it's just, you just have to find wherever you are, it sounds like you have to find a link and then, do you have to submit, do you have to work with your students to submit their ideas, or their locations wherever they want to go; does it have to be that specific week, or can you do it like way in advance?  Kay Taylor: Nope, it's got to be within the, it's got to be within the mission weeks because --  Host: OK.  Kay Taylor: -- as I'm sure you're aware, the ISS shifts somewhat in each orbit. So, we will typically, working with the, working with some of our partners, we have some great technical partners: we have Teledyne Brown Engineering that, that is our kind of liaison between International Space Station and payloads, and the Sally Ride EarthKAM website, and then we have, we have the atmospheric sciences department at the University of Alabama Huntsville, whose graduate students and undergraduate students actually run the mission weeks for us, and then we also have great partners in the information technology and system center at University of Alabama Huntsville, who help us populate those orbits and get those published. And then a teacher logs in and registers in the, in the Sally Ride EarthKAM program at earthkam.org, and our partners at UAH send code words back to the teacher which allow the students during active mission weeks to go in and request their images. And it, so you can see, I, I said that it sounds amazingly easy, because it's NASA and was developed by Sally Ride Science. There are several steps involved, which allow targeted controlled access to, to orbit data, which is used for each specific mission, which varies from mission to mission, and occurs within selected mission weeks. So, it's, it's an elegantly elaborate, yet very practical program, that again allows school children access to real time science on the ISS.  Host: I'd be so pumped if I was a middle school student and got to click the shutter button on a camera in space. That sounds fantastic.  Kay Taylor: [Laughter] Well you know we can, we can work with you. We can work with you. Because we have, while the, while it was originally targeted for middle school students, we have, we have allowed, certainly, any teacher in public education can access our program. We're not going to say you're a fourth-grade teacher, no, no, you cannot participate. We, we've tried to expand our, our opportunities because the teacher or the educator has to register. Each registration is verified by the EarthKAM team to make sure that this is for educational purposes, and we have had success with schools taking part, afterschool learning environments coming on board with us, so, we can, we can definitely work with you if you'd like to, if you'd like to take part in an upcoming mission.  Host: All right, I'll just find the right teacher. So, so I'm stuck on the, the execution of this, right? And I got a lot of other questions, too, but, but I'm wondering during a mission week, so, say I'm a student, I'm logging on and, how many orbits can I see to make sure that if I'm interested in a particular area, how far, how far ahead in the mission week can I see to, to see maybe, maybe it won't, I have to wait a couple of days until the orbit lines up just right where I can take a picture of the thing that I want to take a picture of. So, do you get a lot of that data ahead of time --  Kay Taylor: Absolutely. Absolutely.  Host: Cool.  Kay Taylor: Absolutely. When, when we open up a mission window, we have the orbits projected for the entire mission sequence. So, and it will be broken out on the website, literally by orbital days. So, if you look at day one, there, there may not be a clear path over the target you're interested in, in capturing, or it may be that you look at the orbits and you say, hmm, given the orbits this time, maybe on day two, I want to capture that picture of Cairo; I didn't think I wanted to capture an image of Cairo, but now that I look at it, it seems that's how I want to set my target up. And you'll be able to plug in the latitude and longitude and request that image. And that's through looking at the, the orbital map associated with, with each mission week.  Host: I see, OK. Now, now to give a better sense of the, you know, these orbital maps and the perspective, you talked about this thing called the International Space Station and that's where the camera is. So, so high level, what exactly is the space station and why is this a good place to put a camera to take pictures of the Earth?  Kay Taylor: So, the International Space Station is an orbiting scientific lab that's been just quietly going about its business, zooming around the Earth about 250 miles above the surface of the Earth, for the past 22 years. It is, it's a remarkable accomplish, accomplishment, not only of, of science, but it's a remarkable accomplishment of diplomacy, because of the countries involved in building the space station, assembling the space station in space, which is a pretty incredible achievement on its own accord. But the ISS is a, a multi-national lab, and the astronauts on board the ISS have conducted, for two decades, studies in materials science, studies in the development of, of crystalline structures that are leading to better medicines to help us back here on Earth, they have demonstrated how humans can live off the Earth for extended periods of time. And the ISS has really been a staging ground as we figure out where we go next in space: whether that's the Moon, whether that's Mars, whether that's who knows where. The ISS has been a training ground, but it's also been a fantastic place of pure science. And so, to have this camera on board this, this orbiting laboratory, it, it's a, there's a constant revolution under, underneath where you see the, you see the Earth. What better vantage point to capture the Earth than from space? And we have two lenses that are interchanged on the camera. One is a 50-millimeter lens, one is 180-millimeter lens, so there is a time, a view that is a little more enhanced than at other times, depending on the lens. But over the years with, with these thousands of image requests that have come from students around the world, we have almost a historical look at the Earth from space, that's literally, that has literally mirrored the time that the ISS has been in orbit. So, we have a, kind of a 20-year time sequence of the Earth from space. Now, some of the images -- I'm not going to lie -- feature a lot of clouds, because there typically are clouds between the ISS and the Earth. But, but there are you know, there are coastlines that you can look at; by using your lat[itude] and long[itude] coordinates, you can go back through the images that we've posted and have collected over the years, you can go back and look at coastline changes. You can go back and look at, at how, how cities have grown. They're, you know, if you figure out the latitude and longitude of some, some large population centers, if images have been captured, you have a, you have a “now and then” comparison, or a time lapse. So not only is it, is it the student capturing the image, but it's then thinking about how can I take this image that I've captured, and images that have been captured in the past, and learn more? We have teachers from across disciplines who find value in bringing the EarthKAM program into their classroom. Certainly, learning about coordinates and learning about, and learning about geography is, is an important function with this particular program. As I mentioned, with the clouds, you get a really great view of clouds from space, which is a different perspective than you get of clouds from Earth. So there's, there's a tremendous utility there. And one of my favorite applications, we talk about, we talk about EarthKAM with the various professional development programs for teachers we run, one of my favorite applications is when art teachers talk about how they use EarthKAM in their classrooms, where they talk about the colors and textures of the planet, or when they, when they show these, these wonderful photos with, maybe the clouds give the appearance of the Earth below this, almost this pointillist or even like some kind of Jackson Pollock effect, that they say that using photos of the Earth as a way to inspire creativity from an artist’s eye. That's something we don't often think about when we're talking about something that is traditionally a STEM education experience. But, you know, it all interconnects.  Host: Yeah, and it sounds that way. It sounds like there's a lot of different applications to this. You mentioned, you mentioned, when you talked about the International Space Station as a platform for all this research and in this particular case, education activities, my mind started going to just how it works. I'm thinking about the technical aspect of things. You mentioned changing lenses, you mentioned a camera. How exactly is the EarthKAM, we'll call it equipment, how is the equipment set up on the International Space Station to perform this work?  Kay Taylor: Sure. Again, here's, here's the elegance of simplicity. It is a camera that is connected to a laptop. And on the laptop, I mean the camera is connected by a cable to the laptop. And the, and the laptop has, has uploaded to it from here in Huntsville the camera control files, which tell the camera – which is of course an electronic DSLR (digital single lens reflex) camera -- when to, I don't want to say \"fire,\" I will say to depress the shutter, which causes the shutter to collapse and capture the image. The, the camera files are compiled when students go through the web portal and enter their latitude and longitude data. They can, they can include a bit more secondary data, like, like, almost like labels. They can label, you know, “Brandon's shot of the pyramids of Egypt.” Or you know, “the Colosseum of Rome, or “the Amazon basin.” Really seeing some astounding photos of the Mississippi River flowing into the, the Gulf. And you could, you could put that tag on it, so that there's a little, there's a little metadata there that you can understand what it is you're looking at. So that goes into the, the photo request. And those requests are compiled. And then they literally, the electronic file is transmitted to the, to the ISS, to the laptop on board, which then operates the shutter syncing up the latitude and longitude with the orbital passover. It captures the, captures the image and then the images are sent back, usually within a day or so they will appear populated on the website. And a student, using the code word, they can check their file and they can download the photo. They can save it on their computer. They can then use that photo…I don't know, in a report that explains how they spent their time on the ISS, or if they are, if they're looking to do some sort of, using that data in support of another educational program. It's all there.  Host: So, I -  Kay Taylor: It's literally…go ahead.  Host: I was just going to ask because I'm thinking, I'm thinking of the different shots you can get, right? When you're executing this, and it sounds like you're getting the images and it's going through this web portal. You talked about changing, changing lenses at some point. Is that per mission week? So, for this mission week you get, you get this lens and then this week you're going to get some nice close ups and then another week you'll get, or are astronauts going on and changing lenses during, during the mission week?  Kay Taylor: The astronaut will, one of the astronauts on board the International Space Station will change out the lens, typically once during a mission, about mid-way through, we’ll go from a 180 to a 50-millimeter lens. So, in both instances, because of the, because the International Space Station is roughly 250 miles above the surface of the Earth, you're not going to get, you're not going to be able to get a shot of your house. You know what I'm saying? It's, but the 180 or the 50 does change the field of view. If you're, if you're familiar with photography, if you've taken photos, you know that the smaller the number of the millimeter lens -- so the 50-millimeter lens -- has a wider view than the 180-millimeter lens. The 180 tends to, if you were to take pictures side-by-side, the 180 would appear to be of a smaller area by, by field of view. And you may not -- I don't think you really want to get into that at all on your podcast, because I'm kind of butchering it, and it's kind of in the weeds. The bottom line though is at midway point in the mission week an astronaut does go in and change the lens out.  Host: Very cool. Yeah. And, and the weeds are great. We like details here and that's for sure. So, you talked about the way that teachers and schools are able to access the EarthKAM program. You mentioned, you mentioned an EarthKAM portal. Can you talk about how that works? How a, if a teacher is interested in working with your program and, and decides to submit a registration and gets approved, how they work with EarthKAM to, to execute some of this?  Kay Taylor: Right. So once a teacher has, has registered for the program, as we get closer to mission weeks, we send out communications to let, to let the teacher know when we've posted the orbits. Because by, as we get, as we get closer to the mission week, we can accurately project where the International Space Station will be passing above Earth. So now it's time for the students to look at those orbits and select their targets. When they select the target they would like to photograph, the EarthKAM program sends the teacher a list of code words, and it's a random sequence of letters and numbers, that then the students go into the portal and enter that code word and then it also allows them to enter the latitude and longitude that they wish to target. And from there they, when they hit submit, at different points in the day during mission week, those files are uploaded to the International Space Station, and the laptop cycles through those requests and captures those images, which are then sent back to Earth and are cleaned up, and are then sent to the, our EarthKAM portal where we store them.  Host: OK. And yeah, and you already mentioned that a lot of these are searchable, so, and there's a big repository of images already, given the amount of participation, right? You talked about, you talked about all the schools, you said every state and I think you said 60 countries was the number that you said. I wonder if you have a sense, based on your history with U.S. Space and Rocket Center, and with Earth, with this EarthKAM project, how you've seen the program grow and expand and reach new audiences. What have you seen just in your tenure with U.S. Space and Rocket Center?  Kay Taylor: You know, it's interesting in looking at the data we have from the, from the missions, from, from schools around the country, and schools around the world. There are certain states where we always, we just know we're going to have good participation from those states. And not surprisingly, you might call some of those states “space states.” Texas and Florida, California: great participation. Then you see other states that maybe you wouldn't actually think of participating in strong numbers as well. The same goes with our international partners. There are some partners that have been long-standing participants with Sally Ride EarthKAM. Indeed, there are some schools that have been long-time participants with the program. We have tremendous participation from countries like India, Poland -- Poland has been a participant with this program for the entire two decades. So, I think it's, what we've been striving to do is increase the educational visibility of the program, and the educational utility of the program. And one of the things that, that has been, I think, a nice development, has been that we've been able to offer more students and more classes additional code words, and we've encouraged teachers, if we sent you enough code words for each of your students to submit an image, send us another request so we can give you more code words. And we have expanded the number of image requests and the number of images we're capturing, because, you know, you have to realize the program is somewhat bounded because there are only so many seconds in the mission week. And when the camera is operating at, at full speed it can take, it can snap an image at about 1 to 2 seconds apart. So, you know, you can't say well, we'll accommodate 300 million images over the course of the week, because literally the camera can only function as quickly as the camera can function and recover. So what we've been, what we've been focusing on is trying to reach broader audiences -- as I mentioned, it was originally begun as a middle school program -- we're trying to show utility for that teacher. We're trying to show the, we're trying to demonstrate ways that, that a first-grade teacher or a high school teacher can find value in using the science on board the ISS. So, while we're seeking to expand reach, we're also seeking to expand accessibility.  Host: Very good. And so, building off of that, you know, I wonder what kind of support the EarthKAM project has? I know NASA is one of the agencies that support Sally Ride EarthKAM, and that's, that's a very large reason why we're discussing this today is because we're talking about NASA's overall efforts to, for Earth science and Earth-based projects and this is a big one because of its own unique reach. But I wonder who else is able to support Sally Ride EarthKAM and the support that you're getting?  Kay Taylor: This is a NASA outreach program, and we manage the program. As I mentioned, we have, we have subcontracting partners in the University of Alabama Huntsville and Teledyne Brown Engineering. And then we all coordinate and work with our, our partners at NASA Marshall and NASA Johnson [Space Center] to accomplish this, this amazing outreach effort that has such global reach and is just, is just a way to, to put education at the forefront, and showcasing the importance of international participation and cooperation in space.  Host: Wonderful. Now I wonder, you, you going back to the schools for a second. We talked a lot about how the, you know, how the equipment works and how schools are engaging. But I wonder if, you know, in your years of supporting Sally Ride EarthKAM, if you've heard some anecdote from some teachers on how this has impacted students or different teachers lessons on how they approach unique subjects like space and coordinates and geography or Earth science, clouds, whatever it may be, I wonder if you have some anecdotes that have been passed your way on, on how this program is reaching and influencing kids and teachers?  Kay Taylor: Sure. I, I've had students, excuse me, I've had teachers tell me that students have used their EarthKAM photograph to show that there are no borders visible in space, which is a pretty profound thought. I've had, I've had teachers describe how their students were keen to look at the images to try and, and determine what effect humans are having on the Earth, again, by trying to match up as best possible an image they've taken with that same area taken at some point in the past. I've had teachers discuss how students use the, use the program to, to demonstrate real-time phenomena: we've had a couple of fantastic photographs of hurricanes, volcanoes, flood areas. Students are using the program to get a better perspective of their Earth in very real time. They would direct their, their photographs based upon something they had read about or heard about in the news. I know of one teacher who had a goal in their classroom to try and capture soccer stadiums of Europe. I mean, you know, so, so the topics, the topics can range. I had a teacher describe how he had used the EarthKAM as a way for his students to document life in Cuba. And this was for a high school level world civ[ilization] class. So, I love to hear how teachers have found to, to use the program, because the teachers are the real innovators. But, and whenever I see something that is truly cross disciplinary, I love it. And then, and then as I mentioned, it's a great way to study clouds.  Host: Yeah, this is, this is absolutely fascinating just because you know, you think, you got students taking pictures of the Earth; OK, great. But what are they doing with it? And it sounds like the creativity here is, is limitless. I wonder what you learned, you know, from when you first started, how your mind has expanded, just based on some of the input and based on some of the maybe feedback that you've received, that can be implemented into the program going forward.  Kay Taylor: Well it's, I think, I think what I've learned is that Australia just doesn't take a bad photo, you know? It's just, Australia is just like the most photogenic continent we have. I learned that. The blues, the blues of the water, the oranges, the reds, the greens, the grays of the land mass itself; it's just, if, if Earth had a supermodel it's probably going to be Australia. I think, I think for myself, I love looking at, on these static images, the movement of the Earth. And by that I mean, images of clouds, images of water, images of sand, images of coastlines, all of this that’s captured in that split second, you're seeing, you're seeing this dynamic, dynamic moving Earth. And there's just, you know, there's just, to use the phrase, there's a vibe about it, there is. It's like this vibration about it. I think that's been a lot of fun. But again, I turn completely to the teachers as the innovators, because they're finding ways to, to bring in art history, politics, you know, sociology, geology, geography; they're the ones who really push the program. We just seek to, to give a program to them that they can come back to again and again.  Host: And that's, that's sort of where I want to leave off, Kay, is asking you, you know, you mentioned the growth of the program. It's been around for a number of years, but now you're all over the United States and all over the world. And you mentioned that you're trying to reach audiences beyond middle school, you talked about earlier than middle school and even there are some high school applications that could be used for something, something unique as a civics class, right? But I wonder what excites you thinking about the potential of the program and going forward, and the continued use of, of this camera and these views coming from the International Space Station for years to come?  Kay Taylor: Well certainly. We're going to be, we're going to be shifting over to a newer model Nikon camera, and with that we're going to have enhanced richness in the images. Because of the, because of the, the increased and improved optics, we may be able to better push a night photography experience, because currently, because it is just a standard camera loaded into, into one of the windows facing Earth, you cannot photograph in, in periods of darkness as the, as the space station flies over. The Sun has to be reflecting off the Earth for you to capture the image. With this new Nikon that we've got coming on board, we may be able to really push that and capture some nighttime technology with, with nighttime light, you realize your shutter speed is slowed to capture the light, and the International Space Station is trucking along at about 17,000 miles an hour. So that's difficult. But we're looking forward to testing it out and seeing if we can capture nighttime images of Earth, which would be a great way to study, first of all, the beauty of night lights, but it would also allow you to talk about dark skies, light pollution, it would allow you to highlight the human footprints at night on Earth. So, you know, the ability to capture night photography on Earth would be great. But also, just, just getting the newer camera aboard, we're upgrading the camera files so we should have better performance of the program, being able to use the enhanced optics clearer, higher resolution images. That at the same time, as you know, if you increase the size of the files, you're increasing the data needs, so we're going to have to try and hit a fine balance between, between working the camera in tandem with a laptop and capturing larger image files. But we have, we have about 20 years of data. And you can see over time, with upgrades to the software and upgrades to the camera, you can see better images. I think when we're able to bring this new camera online, which should be this calendar year, I think the images are only going to get better through the program.  Host: That is super exciting, Kay. And I think that's a perfect place to leave off is just to, with the anticipation of some great technology to come. So, Kay, I really want to thank you so much for your participation in the podcast today. I certainly learned a lot about this program and a lot of the unique ways that just images from International Space Station can, can be used, and it is super-exciting to see the reach and how it's reaching students and teachers, and getting folks involved and spreading awareness of what we do on the space station. So, Kay thanks again for coming on this podcast and sharing what you do.  Kay Taylor: I -- really appreciate you reaching out. I am so glad to be a part of this incredible podcast. And I would just say for, for my final word, anyone who would be interested in joining up on our next mission, it's earthkam.org. You can, you can work with us. We're going to be, as I noted, we're going to be upgrading the optics, we're going to be upgrading the, the camera files, and we're going to in the next year, upgrade the website, hopefully give a cleaner experience. So, come along with us and join us four to five times a year and take a picture from space.  Host: [Laughter] All right, thanks so much, Kay. Have a good one.  Kay Taylor: Thanks.  [ Music]  Host: Hey thanks for sticking around! I hope you learned something today with Dr. Kay Taylor. I know I did. I didn't really know a lot about the Sally Ride EarthKAM program, but now I do.

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 88: The Heroes Behind the Heroes. I'm Pat Ryan, your host for a special edition of the podcast. Ordinarily, we talk to NASA scientists, and engineers, and astronauts, and others about the cool stuff they're doing right now, but this time, we're going to veer off that course a bit, and let me tell you why. Several months ago, I was in a regular meeting where we talk about stories the NASA Public Affairs Office in Houston could or should do, and, well, you know how meetings can get. I suddenly snapped to a story that one of my coworkers was pitching. It had to do with a university professor from Dallas and some of his students who had worked with voice recordings of the flight control team in Houston during the first Moon landing, and they had to make use of an enormous piece of ancient audio equipment that has lived in one of the rooms here in our production facilities for years. It's a big, green monster that I have never, ever seen in operation, even one time. Well, the more he told of the story, the more it struck me as a terrific mystery. Well, not exactly a whodunit, but maybe a how they do that, or they did what? Well, you'll see as we go along. So I talked to him more after the meeting, and we agreed to try to produce this story for the podcast. His name is Greg Wiseman. He's one of the audio engineers in the Media Production Services Department here at JSC. And you'll hear him as part of the ensemble of voices that we're about to unleash on you. What's coming up now is the story we flesh out, starting with Greg's recollection, plus podcast interviews I did with 8 people who lived the story, and narration by me as a means to tie all the pieces together. So to invoke the spirit of Gary, here we go with the story of the rescue of the audio of the Apollo 11 Mission Control Center.  [ Music ]  Host: A regular by-product of the work done by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the creation of pieces of history. It's a natural occurrence when your job description is to do things that have never been done before. I'll wager that you've heard some of the highlights before.  Neil Armstrong: Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.  Charlie Duke (Capcom): Rocket Tranquility, we copy on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.  Host: And this bit, which came just hours later.  Neil Armstrong: That's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.  Host: But it's a lot less likely that you've heard this bit of history before.  Flight Director: T2 stay/no stay, all flight controllers. T2 stay/no stay. RETRO?  RETRO: Stay.  Flight Director: FDO?  FDO: Stay.  Flight Director: Guidance?  Guidance: Stay.  Flight Director: CONTROL?  CONTROL: Stay.  Flight Director: Telcom?  Telcom: Stay.  [ Unintelligible ]  Flight Director: EECOM?  EECOM: Stay.  Flight Director: Surgeon?  Surgeon: Stay.   Flight Director:  Capcom we’re stay for T2.  Host: Or this one.  Jack Schmitt: Excuse me Fred.  Fred Haise: Yeah.   Jack Schmitt: This is Jack Schmitt  Fred Haise: Yeah.  Jack Schmitt: Say, is John around?  Fred Haise: John who?  Jack Schmitt: John Young?  Fred Haise: No, he's not here.  Jack Schmitt: I was just wondering. I'd like to get a in flight, somebody who's looked at it before opinion so people are--  Host: Those first 2 clips came from Apollo 11, the mission that put the first human beings on the surface of the Moon. The second 2 clips also came from Apollo 11, and there's a story behind how we have them available for you to hear. It's the story of how a small group of dedicated scientists and engineers saved part of America's spaceflight history while they were trying to build machines that could better understand us when we talk.  Like most good stories, this one does not go in a straight line from Point A to Point B. That would be the shortest distance between the 2 points, but not necessarily the most interesting trip. This narrative runs into unexpected developments. And the way the characters in the story deal with those roadblocks is as much a part of the lesson as is their achievement of their original goal. The story involves elements of sophisticated analytics and engineering and other stuff that I find interesting as hell, even though I can't do the math on my own. It also has important and exciting world history. And near the end, we'll tell you how you can access that history on your own. The story has 2 beginnings on unrelated tracks -- Points A and B, I guess -- which merge with one another in 2013 at Point C and then move forward.  [ Music ]  One track begins in Plainfield, New Jersey near the dawn of the Space Age with the birth of a smart and curious boy who would grow up to earn a bachelor's degree with highest honors from Rutgers and then a master's with highest honors and a doctorate from Georgia Tech, all in electrical engineering. His name is John Hansen, and he studied digital signal processing and speech processing and communications and biomedical engineering, and he wrote a dissertation entitled [clears throat] \"Analysis and Compensation of Stressed and Noisy Speech with Application to Robust Automatic Recognition.\" All of this is to say that back in the 1980's, when none of us carried portable phones that understood what we said to them and followed our instructions, John Hansen was helping develop machines that could understand human speech. It was a focus of his academic research, which continued at Duke, and Colorado, and, since 2005, at the University of Texas at Dallas, where he's now the Associate Dean for Research at UTD's Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science. He's also the university Distinguished Chair in Telecommunications Engineering and the director and founder of the Center for Robust Speech Systems, among other things. When it comes to speech recognition technology, he knows his stuff.  The other track stretches back, as they sometimes say, from time immemorial [echo]. Even in caveman times, the human residence of Planet Earth had had a curiosity about the lights in the nighttime sky. Maybe the other animals had it too. But anyway, humans have paid attention to the things in the skies, and made use of them, and wondered about them. The Ask an Astronomer website at Cornell University cites early civilizations that use the bodies that moved across their skies to keep track of time, to orient their cities. They named the stars and plotted their positions. By the Middle Ages, they'd proven that the Sun is the center of our solar system and described the orbits of the planets. And they used telescopes to get a close look at the planets and the Moon, Earth's largest natural satellite. The fact that the Moon has been on our minds is reflected in art through the ages. Just go online and search \"Moon in art.\" You'll see what I mean. It's also in music -- \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"Bad Moon Rising,\" \"Moondance,\" \"Moon River,\" \"Blue Moon,\" \"Pink Moon,\" \"Dark Side of the Moon.\" It was also the subject of A Trip to the Moon. It's one of the earliest science fiction films. You know the one -- the, with the image of the bullet-shape rocket ship stuck in the Man in the Moon's eye. In the latter half of the 20th century, the idea of sending people to the Moon became a goal during the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. That started over the nuclear arms race and the development of ballistic missile technology in the service of national defense. And that led to launching artificial satellites to Earth orbit, and then to launching probes out of Earth orbit, and then, well, then it was let's launch people to the Moon. And here we are back in Texas in Houston at Rice University with President John Kennedy. He had proposed to Congress in mid 1961 that the United States should establish the Moon landing as a goal. And that led to NASA's creation of Project Apollo and, with it, the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. When the president came to Houston to visit the construction site in September of 1962, he gave a speech at Rice University that was designed to drum up popular support for the American space program. Here's an extended cut.  President John Kennedy: Surely, the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships as well as high reward. So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But this city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited, and rested, and wished to look behind them.  [ Applause ]  This country was conquered by those who moved forward, and so will space. William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage. If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time. And no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the Industrial Revolution, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power. And this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it.  [ Applause ]  For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the Moon and to the planets beyond. And we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding. Yet, the vows of this nation can only be fulfilled if we in this nation are first. And therefore, we intend to be first.  [ Applause ]  In short, our leadership in science and industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as well as others all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world's leading space-faring nation. We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won. And they must be won and used for the progress of all peace. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new, terrifying theater of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind. And its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills. Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.   [ Applause ]  Host: The president's stated goal in September 1962 was to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, which was just 7 years down the road at the time. NASA and its commercial partners got busy, designing and building spacecraft, testing and flying, and testing and flying some more, drawing up detailed plans for space missions and Moon missions, and developing the architecture and the hardware for the systems on the ground that would support the flights to Earth orbit and then to the Moon.  [ Music ]  Christopher Kraft was one of the first few dozen engineers hired to get the Space Task Group going when NASA was created in 1958. He was assigned to work in flight operations for Project Mercury at a time when no one had flown in space yet. Kraft and his colleagues had to figure out how to coordinate the ground support, the spacecraft tracking, the communications networks, the flight plans and procedures, the timelines, everything. And Kraft decided that the astronaut in a spacecraft shouldn't be responsible for coordinating all the parts of the spaceflight during the spaceflight. He's credited with coming up with the concept of the mission control center, the location where engineers with expertise in all the systems that would be needed during a flight could keep an eye on the latest telemetry data for their area of responsibility. And all of them would work in concert to move the mission toward its goal, and they would do that under the leadership of the flight director. Chris Kraft served as NASA's first flight director, call sign RED WHITE, and he was key to inventing the mission planning and control processes that NASA's been using ever since. Today, the building that houses these flight control rooms in Houston is named the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center. The dozen or more operators who are on duty during any shift in the control room are plugged in to a voice communication system that has many individually selectable voice channels, which are referred to as loops. This system allows the flight director and each member of the team to talk to one another right there in the room without having to get up from their desk or shout across the room. It also allows each member of the team to communicate with their own support staff, who are located off the main floor in what are referred to as the back rooms. They can also listen to the conversation when the astronauts in space talk to the capsule communicator, called the Capcom, who sits right next to the flight director and is the sole conduit to relaying information back and forth. That conversation happens on a loop called Air to Ground or Space to Ground. Well, let me give you an example: a little slice of life from mission control, Houston, during the Apollo 11 mission.  Voice 1: Hey Telcom?  Voice 2: Telcom Inco.  Voice 1: If you look on page 3-55 A of your flight plan, you'll see that that at 85 hours—  [ Overlapping Voices 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. ]  Host: Well, you can hear there are a lot of voice loops on the system, and any or all of them could have voice traffic going at any time. What you can probably also figure out, when you think about it, is that an organization like NASA that is famous for its attention to detail, and for striving to have backups to every plan and backups to the backups, just in case, and which tries not to leave any stone unturned over, NASA made the decision way back in the day that the traffic on all these voice loops needed to be recorded. So they needed people to tend to the recorders and the playback machines.  Larry Vrooman: My name is Larry Vrooman. I started working with Fort Aerospace the first week of January 1979. And the recorder, they actually made me, as a technician, responsible for its service and maintenance, that the single playback machine and both recorders were my responsibility until they were retired in 1982.  Host: Now, the machines you're referring there, to there, the recorders and playback machines, help me understand what they were, what they were designed to do, and, if you know, why they decided they needed those things.  Larry Vrooman: I think they may be unique in that they were contracted, and designed, and manufactured specifically for Fort Aerospace -- i.e. NASA. But they were 30-track machines. And at the time, that was a large or intense compaction of channels and probably was the max available at the time in 1961. They were logging recorders, audio logging recorders. They were also, similar models were also used by police departments to record phone lines and their various phone calls. That's what I, that was my understanding is that they were normally used for phone call recording.  Host: And in the case of NASA, they were recording the voice activity in the Mission Control Center?  Larry Vrooman: Not just the Mission Control Center.  Host: Oh, where else?  Larry Vrooman: A lot of the audio channels, we called them loops. The way they set up the audio system in the building, we called them loops, and each loop could be internal, or external, or domestic, or international based upon its function. And as an example, we had a lot of issues with feedback sometimes or oscillations and funny noises in the system, and it was a constant battle to keep that in control because the, some of those channels went, some of those loops went worldwide.  Host: And the loops we're talking about, these are voice communication channels--  Larry Vrooman: It's a lot like a telephone line, but it's local, and domestic, and international. We had 1 playback machine, which is the one you've seen. And then, there was, in effect, 4 recorders. There were 2 racks. Each rack had 2 tape decks in them so they could hand over to each other and, therefore, run 24 hours a day. There were 2 racks. Each machine would, basically, was a backup for the other. If there was a major failure in 1 machine, you just switched to the other machine. It had 2 decks you could continue to run and meet all your requirements. The -- and in fact, we had 1 failure that caused us a few days or weeks of downtime on 1 machine. And it's a good thing that the other machine ran fine during that time. The tapes that I myself handled in recording, we would put them in a rack at the completion of every day, and mark them, and keep them for a year or 2 or so. As long as we were still getting requests from the various flight controllers or whoever needed it, we would need to keep the tapes there, and we would play back and make secondary recordings for them, little snippets here and there. They were used for various purposes.  Host: Like, purposes like what?  Larry Vrooman: Well, an astronaut might want to review an experiment that he did, and he might have some audio that he did down to the ground with scientists or whoever. And he might want to review that to create a transcript or something like that. It just, multiple things. I've had lots of -- I'll give you a story.  Host: Yeah.  Larry Vrooman: I had a Secret Service agent come in one day wanting some audio. I don't even remember what he wanted. But at the end of making the tape, he's standing there, and he goes, \"How do I pay for this?\" And I said, \"Well, you pay taxes?\" He said, \"Yeah.\" And I said, \"It's paid for.\" [laughter]  Host: Good, so--  Larry Vrooman: We had requests from, you know, everywhere for various purposes, and NASA's an open agency. Anybody asks, we try to provide.  Host: So there were tapes of the conversations of the team of flight controllers who oversaw the successful first landing of man on the Moon. Those might really be interesting for historians or for people who do research in speech processing and language technology.  John Hansen: I do research primarily in speech processing and language technology.  Host: People like John Hansen.  [ Music ]  John Hansen: My name is John Hansen, and my title -- I serve as Associate Dean for Research as well as a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas.  Host: And a lot of your work, I take it, is in research. What are your research areas of interest?  John Hansen: So I do research primarily in speech processing and language technology. So that involves looking at audio analysis, extracting information out of those audio streams. That would include speaker recognition, speech recognition, language identification. We also work on applications that might help people that have hearing loss. And perhaps extracting knowledge from audio that might help in the educational space.  Host: That's hard for me to even follow, the, just the range of things you're talking about there. Are you creating a new area of [laughs] academic research?  John Hansen: No. No, I, the reason why it sounds like it's such broad or wide is because the field has evolved over many years. So I've been a professor for 28 years, and if you were to go back, you know, into the 1980's, 1990's, the main emphasis or focus there, like for speech recognition, was actually small vocabulary -- small, handheld devices or voice control. Maybe 10, 20 words or 100 words at most. People were always dreaming and trying to do larger vocabulary speech recognition, but the computing infrastructure was not available at the time. And also, the algorithms were not very mature. And so as time goes on, problems evolve and become different. And I would say, certainly, over the last 10 to 20 years, computing infrastructure has greatly changed the field of speech processing and language technology. And so now, there are new, emerging problems that people weren't trying to solve 20 years ago, but are actually introducing and helping society in a really nice way.  Host: As I've been looking at the story of these tapes, I ran into some stuff that said you got started -- the beginning of the story has to do with you trying to find recordings of conversations that involved many, many people. I've also seen where it looked like this evolved out of you trying to find examples of groups solving problems. Is either of those really where this story starts?  John Hansen: Yeah. Actually -- it's actually correct, yeah. What, one of the things we looked for is when you look at speech technology, as an engineer, you, you're wanting to solve maybe some signal processing work, maybe developing language models or understanding how people pronounce words and so forth. But that's actually kind of like laying bricks, you know. If you're building a wall or building a house, you can lay that foundation. But what you do after you have that, you know, there's other people, other things that you might want to do. And so people, for example, in a society, maybe in education, maybe in psychology, are interested in seeing, well, if you could identify or recognize the text of what someone says, how do you interpret how they interact with other people? What do they actually mean when they said these things? And so probably the examples one could look at in, you know, over the last maybe 15 or 20 years might be looking at natural disasters or areas where major security issues. If you look, for example, at 9/11, okay, you might say, all right, well, when an event like this happens maybe in New York City or Washington, D.C. and so forth, how do people actually work collaboratively together? They probably weren't working together before an event happened. And the instant it does happen, how do people actually connect and understand the chain of command? Who's responsible for making which decisions? You can also look for natural disasters -- Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, for example, here in the Gulf Coast areas. How do people actually, you know, work collaboratively in these modes?  Host: How does a random group of individuals suddenly turn into a group?  John Hansen: Yeah, that's true. And so, you know, the field of speech and language technology, most, you know, if you look at all the work that's been done in the field of speech technology, the vast majority, over the last 50 years, is focused on the telephone. But the telephone has always been point to point -- one person talking to another person over a handset. And today, when we look at smartphone technologies, it's much more likely that you would have group discussions. You're going to have more than 1, more than 2 people kind of working or interacting together. And so the problem in the field of speech and language technology is that there really are no corpora available that look at group dynamics and group interaction. And so when we approached the National Science Foundation, we said we really wanted to kind of come up with research that would advance multi-speaker analyses to try and understand how people work collaboratively together.  Host: And the National Science Foundation was interested. Tatiana Korelsky is the program director of the division that focuses on things like human speech technologies, speech analysis, and speech synthesis. And she reviewed Hansen's proposal and request for funding.  Tatiana Korelsky: So the proposal that he submitted was, in a sense, very unique because it was meant to use the integration of existing and slightly beyond the state-of-the-art speech technologies, such as diarization and automatic speech recognition, to process very particular, unique data and data which was not trivial. It was very noisy, very multichannel, very multi-speaker. So it was a very, very difficult type of data to process by speech technology. So in that respect and also, an additional, of course, that wasn't just any corpus. It was the corpus of Apollo tapes, which, in what we call broader impact, was very important because it was very important corpus, which is like our legacy of space program and, in general, a great American achievement. That's why it was, like, on many, in many aspects, this proposal was unique and very interesting.  Host: That's right. Hansen proposed doing this research using the audio recorded in mission control, Houston, during the first landing of men on the Moon in July 1969. But why use Apollo 11?  John Hansen: But we couldn't go to 9/11, let's say, New York City. You couldn't go to, like, you know, Hurricane Katrina events and things like this because many of the audio that we could get access to could potentially not be released. In addition to that, none of them were synchronized, so it's very hard to understand who was doing what and at what time if you don't have a common time frame. And so those challenges actually NASA solved for us because when we went back, we started doing some homework in looking at Apollo. And we saw, well, lo and behold, NASA recorded all this with timecode. That was the big plus.  Host: How did you become aware that that had even happened? If you had gone to the National Science Foundation and were looking for help but didn't know where there was, you know, what turns out to be a recording of many people talking all over each other all at the same time, how did you know that that was even there?  John Hansen: We knew that NASA recorded the audio. A lot of the Air to Ground, called Capcom, that's been released. And so at least that communication we knew was there. However, most of the audio that involved Mission Control, a lot of the back room discussions, support staff that were providing support to Mission Control, most of that audio had never really been released. And we thought, well, this actually would be an interesting space to look at. You know, the average, you know, K-12 type student pretty much knows hopefully most of the astronauts, at least the 12 Moon walkers. But most do not know who was working behind the scenes.  Host: Did you know that those conversations had been recorded?  John Hansen: Well, one of the things that, growing up -- and I was a little kid when we walked on the Moon--  Host: So was I.  John Hansen: Yeah, yeah. And for me, the thing I always remembered in looking at every picture or any video played from Mission Control, there was always, you know, a NASA scientist, engineer, specialist -- white shirt, little black tie, and a headset. The headset was always on. I could always see that. And so being a speech and audio type person, my feeling was if anyone has an audio set, that means that audio's got to be recorded somewhere. At least, I would always hope that. And we were pretty fortunate that NASA still had all of these recordings and all of the tapes.  Host: Tell, okay, so you, it was your hunch that NASA had recordings of all these conversations?  John Hansen: Yeah, but we were a little naive, and one of the reasons is because when we wrote the proposal to the National Science Foundation, we had just assumed that NASA had all this in digital format and it was already available. And so we put the proposal in, and NSF and the reviewers really thought this would be an enormously valuable effort to support, one because it would advance the speech and language technology, but even more importantly, it would certainly preserve the audio that would've come from this, probably the most significant engineering accomplishment mankind has had over the last 100 years. But it would also give people outside of the technology side the ability to start looking at human aspects. How do actually people work collaboratively together? When do they become unhappy about things? And this actually might help motivate kids to go into STEM, we hope. It also might allow us to have a better understanding if we're sending folks to the, to Mars, how they might actually collaborate in a stronger way.  Host: Tatiana Korelsky wanted to make sure I knew what the review panel thought of Hansen's proposal, so she read me a part of the evaluation.  Tatiana Korelsky: So this is what they said. \"The most creative and original concepts related to the combination of technologies and enhancements which will come together by way of the focused research on spoken audio in the NASA archives. This is a task just beyond the reach of current technology due to the combination of channel conditions, background noise, and the type of speech. Spontaneous conversational speech, over often under stress conditions. So that challenges our characteristic of real-world data, which makes the need to address them pressing if the full potential of information locked within spoken content is to be realized.\" After such evaluation, of course, the program decision was to award this project, which started in -- the proposal was 2012, so we started at the end of fiscal year 2012 and lasted until 2016, with some extension.  Host: So as I understand it, the basic area of research that he was proposing was something that you found to be of interest. And the choice to have the subject be about the Apollo missions, that historic event, was something that made it even sweeter, even nicer.  Tatiana Korelsky: Of course. Of course. That's why I say it was a unique proposal.  Host: So you went to the National Science Foundation with a proposal to do this project, assuming that NASA had recorded all those conversations back in 1969?  John Hansen: Recorded them and hopefully, we thought, digitized them.  Host: Well, I was going to make that a separate part of it. So then, you, I assume, the next step is to go to NASA and say, please?  John Hansen: Well, we needed the money first, so, yeah. So we were pretty fortunate NSF said this was a good thing to do. But we still had some concerns. And so we had to resubmit it a second time. It took more than a year. And it was interesting because I was at a conference involving Department of Defense, and there was a gentleman that walked up to me and said, \"Well, I hear you have interest in Apollo and NASA.\" And I was kind of surprised because I didn't think someone would know about that, and I started, you know, running off I was, you know, a geeky engineer and said, \"Yeah, we're really excited about this. We hope NSF will fund this the next time.\" And the gentleman said that, \"Well, yeah. I was kind of involved in the review process, and I can't officially say anything, but it's a really good project. You probably need to have someone that is more involved on the history side also involved.\" And that was actually a thing that we added when we resubmitted, and it made a difference because it allowed us now not just to focus on the technology, but be able to kind of connect it to society. We really wanted to have something that would allow K-12 type kids to kind of see and listen to the audio.  Host: So it was no longer just the academic investigation of the interaction of the individuals in this group, but that the individuals in this group were the people who landed on the Moon.  John Hansen: That's right. That's right. That's right.  Host: Which people we'd hopefully be a little more interested in.  John Hansen: Yeah, so, I mean, I, a lot of the technology and things that we've done with this work over the last 5, 6 years now, we've gone, in Dallas, we've gone to the Perot Museum pretty much every year for Engineers Week. And we've usually brought a, always brought an undergraduate senior design team to the Perot Museum. And it's nice to sit back and allow undergraduates to kind of show how excited they are in terms of talking about audio and these types of activities. And at least during the Perot Museum, they typically have about 1500 to 2500 kids per day during Engineers Week that actually come in. And they're little kids. I mean, they're through K-12 -- maybe not through 12. Maybe K-8 is where they're coming. And that, to me, was really a very enjoyable thing because you always think, well, we'll develop technologies. It'll be in the college level. How does that actually help kids that are in grade school, and what might motivate them to kind of go and look not necessarily at being an astronaut, but developing math, physics, chemistry, biology, or something that might actually help support space exploration?  Host: Hansen succeeded at the National Science Foundation, which awarded the first grant in September of 2012 just shy of $400,000 to fund the project. That meant Hansen was ready to approach NASA with his idea and that he was about to get a big surprise.  John Hansen: Right after we got the grant, we came down to NASA. And I naively said, \"Well, can you show us where you have the audio?\" And Greg Wiseman pointed us to some boxes of tapes, and I'd said, \"We're in trouble here because we thought this was all digitized.\"  Host: And that's not all. Hansen was about to find out that not only was the audio still on big reel-to-reel tapes, but there was no machine that could play those tapes so he could digitize the audio so he could do his research. In the next episode, we'll start the long, strange trip to a solution to those problems.  [ Music ]  Yep, the story turned out to be too big to cram it all into one episode and do it justice, so we're breaking it into a few pieces. I hope you're hooked and will come back for the rest.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center: Episode 196, “The Astronaut Schedulers.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. A few times on this podcast, we've discussed astronaut training. Longtime listeners may know the basics. You have your training in T-38 jets, you have spacewalk training in the giant pool called the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, you have your systems training in space station mockups at the Johnson Space Center, science training, maintenance training, etc. What we haven't really explored in depth yet is the massive coordination it takes to get all the astronaut training crammed in before their spaceflight, along with all of the personal items that go with such a busy schedule, and it is astounding. We're talking the project management of everything from negotiating with the international agencies to scheduling an astronaut's kid's daycare pickup. And all of this, for every astronaut and cosmonaut from partner agencies, is managed by a small team of five women at NASA. Today, we sit down with a few of those women to hear the lesser-known, but critical role of what it takes to manage an astronaut's schedule before their spaceflight. Joining us is Alicia Robinson and Crystal Larsen, increment training integrators at NASA. So, let's get right into it. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Alicia and Crystal, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Alicia Robinson: Thanks so much for having us, Gary. This is really exciting. I'm looking forward to talking with you.  Crystal Larsen: I agree. We are excited to be here.  Host: I'm looking forward to talking with each of you. I was just talking to some of my colleagues ahead of this podcast, and I was like, hey, hey, I'm going to be talking to the increment training integrators. And they said, oh, great. And they said, ask them, ask them a bunch of questions, because I know they do a lot, but I don't know if we understand the full scope of what you do. It's actually quite incredible. And I can't wait to get into it. I want to start, though, with understanding about what it takes to be an integrator. What I think is, I think the ultimate project manager for a person's life, right, that's what I'm thinking, but I want to understand a little bit about what it takes to have this role. Alicia, we'll start with you.  Alicia Robinson: OK, great. So, you are correct, it is the ultimate project manager for someone's life. And we take it very seriously because we do encompass not only their training, but it does affect their personal life as well. So, we have to look at all facets of a crew member. So, I actually have a degree in criminology, which I'm sure you're going to want to ask how that equates, but really, it's my negotiation skills that I learned through having a degree in criminology that helps me in my job, because it's all about negotiations. Time, countries, it's all about negotiation. So, you have to be able to negotiate and plan ahead, long-term planning, and then when someone comes in and changes the plan, changes the crew members, you just have to be ready to fly with it. So, you have to maintain flexibility.  Host: That is perfect. Crystal, what about you? What kind of background do you come from?  Crystal Larsen: I have a degree in aerospace engineering. I started here at Johnson Space Center right after I graduated, working on shuttle flights in the FAO (Flight Activities Officer) group. And so, I actually started with the experience of planning for the crew but planning for the mission duration once they're onboard. I've been here for almost 14 years, and just a few years ago, I transferred to the crew office where I started planning for the crew prior to launch. So, definitely consideration of all different types of milestones and requirements that we put together in order to make a mission successful before and after. I'd say a lot of experience also comes from being a mom, being able to multitask and manage every day and understand what people need personally and professionally, in order to get things accomplished really helps us out in our job.  Host: Very, very important. Now, we're getting some hints of what you, what you all do. We talked about a project manager for someone's life. Alicia, you talked about negotiations. Both of you talked about planning. And then, you also talked about missions. So, Crystal, I'm going to go back to you to help me understand just, just what is the role of an increment training integrator?  Crystal Larsen: So, our job is basically to have an astronaut ready to launch, means they have to be completely trained, certified, ready to go. We start that one to two years prior to their launch date, once they get assigned. And we are responsible for building and scheduling their whole training program. That includes international trips, requirements, we schedule classes, evaluations, simulations, language training, everything you can think of, medical preparations, anything that the crew is going to have to do. We gather all these inputs from all the different locations, and then the first thing we do is we meet with our international counterparts to develop a template, which is basically like a weekly calendar, so we know how many weeks the crew members are going to need to train here and in other countries. And then from there we start refining those details. So, whenever the astronauts are training here in the U.S., we start putting together a plan, daily, of all of their activities that they're going to have to complete. It is something that is an integration of lots of different inputs. It gets very dynamic when you add personal constraints, facility constraints, we're limited to how many astronauts can be training in a specific facility, at a certain time. We have off-nominal scenarios where something might get canceled or moved and it has a ripple effect on the upcoming weeks because it might be a prerequisite to all the next classes. We have different requirements for maybe a whole crew to do a certain class together, and then another class only one crew member needs it. So it's kind of a giant game of Tetris all day, every day. And we build a plan for the crew members for every day that they're in training to make sure that they are successfully qualified to launch when it comes time.  Host: OK, so I'm thinking about scope here based on what you said, Crystal. So, Alicia, what I'm hearing is there is, your focus really, right, you get assigned, it sounds like you might get assigned a mission. So, a group of astronauts from multiple countries are assigned a mission. I guess it's your job to manage that particular group of astronauts, and then you get assigned by that group. So, so, what does that include? Does that include all of the astronauts in that group? How many groups do you have like at a time? I'm trying to think about the scope of your work here.  Alicia Robinson: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, it's changed over time, because I too started many years ago. My very first flight was Expedition 7. And at that time, we only had the three Soyuz crew members. And yes, one ITI manages the full complement of the crew on that vehicle. Right? So, and then on shuttle, we managed seven people, because that's how many people you had on that vehicle. Right now, we're managing between three to seven people because you may have a group that's on the Soyuz that you're managing, as well as the group that's flying on the commercial vehicle, which is four crew members. So you'll have NASA astronauts, you'll have whatever partner agency is on there. For example, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) or ESA (European Space Agency), or a cosmonaut from Russia. Soj you do manage the entire vehicle, whoever's on the vehicle. And because it can expand one or two increments, depending upon the length of stay, that's how you could end up with maybe having a Soyuz vehicle on top of a Commercial Crew vehicle complement.  Host: I got it. You're talking about a period of time. And that can include multiple visiting vehicles going to the destination, which is the International Space Station.  Alicia Robinson: That is correct. Absolutely.  Host: Got it. So, Crystal, do you have some help, right? So, it sounds like you're working with a lot of astronauts from across multiple countries all over the world. Do they have training integrators that you are doing some of these negotiations with, in terms of timing, so you get a little bit of help from the folks that are at the respective agencies?  Crystal Larsen: Absolutely. We have counterparts at all the different agencies that we meet with regularly in order to determine what requirements are going to be needed for that crew complement for each mission, what level they're going to have to qualify their training to, and all the different partner centers, and so we coordinate to determine how much time is needed there, and then each international partner will actually manage the training at their center for that crew member. So, we work together to make sure that all the training gets accomplished here and at all the partner centers, in the appropriate time.  Host: Got it. So, again, I'm thinking about scope, right? So, it sounds like you're specifically for astronauts, cosmonauts around the world that are assigned to a mission, right? But that doesn't include everyone that's in an astronaut corps. There are astronauts that have flown but are probably going to, assigned to do other duties. Then you have the astronaut candidates. What are the other, I’m trying to think about the whole role of, you know, who manages an astronaut's time? So, we have you as the integrators, but what are some of the other roles in the astronaut office for managing the other astronaut’s times?  Crystal Larsen: So, we have counterparts that are in the crew operations branch, which actually take over the scheduling for the currently unassigned astronaut. So, that's, for example, like you mentioned, astronauts who may have flown, but are not currently assigned or working on other job duties. And it also includes astronaut candidates when we have a new class that are going through their training. So, we have counterparts that work in that office up until a crew member is assigned, and then they're kicked over back to the, our team, the increment integrators.  Host: I see. All right, Alicia, let's get into it. Let's just say you just got assigned a crew. An increment has been named, and the crew has been named, and you know who's going to be flying, so you have to kick into gear and start, start organizing their schedule. What are some of the first things on your checklist to do?  Alicia Robinson: First thing you do is you look at the manifest schedule to see what operations they'll be performing on orbit. So, you have to figure out, are they going to need EVA (extravehicular zctivity) training? Are they going to need robotics training? Identify who's going to be prime for those tasks with a partner, modules of Columbus or JEM (Japanese Experiment Module), you have to determine who's going to be the specialist, the leads on that. So, that's when the international group gets together, and we all look at those pieces. Then we have a document called the MA/ITP, Multilateral Advanced Increment Training Plan, which is the basic document from all partner agencies that tells you what the requirements are for each system and for each module and task. So, that is the baseline. And then from there, we tailor it based on the astronaut or cosmonaut’s experience level to determine how much time is needed in any partner agency site, and then that's how when Crystal mentioned the Tetris, the weekly calendar, that's how we determine when they're going to be in the U.S. to train, when they're going to be in Russia to train, ESA, JAXA, CSA (Canadian Space Agency), depending on their tasking. So, that is basically ground zero, you start with that document and then you tailor and customize from there.  Host: I see. And it sounds like there's this, a lot of the tailoring and customization that you're talking about is, it sounds like a lot of it is related to experience. So, maybe if they have flown before, and especially with some of these recent missions that we've been seeing, have flown recently, right, so Mark Vande Hei, Kate Rubins, they've flown to the International Space Station very recently, so maybe they can cut down on certain things, because it's really a refresher course for them.  Alicia Robinson: You're absolutely right. So, yeah, we do have what's called an experience flow for those type of people, but just like you said, if they've flown very recently, you can even tailor that a little bit shorter. And we have the full inexperience flow, like the amazing launch we just had, we had a rookie cosmonaut on there, well he would have, he would have taken the entire flow, because it was his first flight.  Host: That's right. That's referencing the Soyuz MS-18 that just launched. We're recording this today, when it just launched and docked, with Mark Vande Hei onboard.  Alicia Robinson: Absolutely. And I want to give a shout out to Crystal, because that is her crew.  Host: Really? So, Crystal, you're in the middle of all of it, huh?  Crystal Larsen: Yes. This was actually my first complete crew, yes.  Host: So, so, when you're managing a crew schedule, do you manage everything on the ground and in orbit, or is really your job mostly getting them ready for flight?  Crystal Larsen: Our job is getting them ready for flight. We basically hand them over to the Mission Control Center once, once they launch, they start taking care of completing mission priorities and tasking on orbit.  Host: I see. OK, all right, so, so, Alicia, you were talking about different things that they might have to do on orbit, right? What do you find are some of the most common things that you have been putting into the training flows of all of the astronauts? See, when I think of it, I think about getting ready for station training, you know, making sure they know how to work the experiments, how they do maintenance, maybe some Neutral Buoyancy Lab. What do you think are the most common things you've got to fit into that schedule?  Alicia Robinson: Yeah. And it's actually, now, and when I look back to when I started station, Expedition 7, it was very, very increment-specific, like, you know, you had to train so specifically to that increment. Now, we are kind of more baseline and we're kind of more in maintenance because before we were building the station. So, now that we're kind of in just like maintaining mode, they do a lot of maintenance training for the exterior of the station, which, as you mentioned, is the EVA training at the NBL, the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, and then they do have some robotic operations that they need to perform. So, those are two of the high-ticket items. Of course, experiments are a priority. So, they have their payload training for experiments, their baseline data collections, because they, themselves can be a part of an experiment. And then, of course, they have to know how all the systems work in all the modules. So they have to have all of their life support training, as well, and fire, depress[urization] in case of an emergency. So, those are the main things that we train. But there's so many other things. And appearances even, actually, we have to make sure that they're comfortable to do appearances, and education outreach. So, we take time to make sure that they have an opportunity to practice that on the ground as well.  Host: That's right. And I know we request quite a number of those from our end, here in PAO (Public Affairs Office). Crystal, you mentioned, well, I heard at least a little earlier, the timeline was approximately maybe a year and a half to two years, which to me, I mean, if I were to just think about that training for two years, that sounds like a lot of time. But I don't think folks may understand, what they might not understand is just everything you have to fit into that timeline. And we're getting a sense of it now. Especially, what Alicia just said: not only all this training, but we're talking about, you know, events, there's some personal items, you know, what exactly is the, really the challenge of fitting everything into that one and a half to two years?  Crystal Larsen: It always seems to be a challenge to fit it in. It always seems like we're short on weeks for one reason or another. I mean, you have to figure that for a year and a half to two years of training, these astronauts are not only going to need to be training every week to meet these objectives, they also need vacation time. They also need recovery time. They also need to not be overworked every single week. So, we have to keep them at a reasonable amount of work hours. We have to spread out their technical training. We have to make sure they're getting physical training in there every week to stay healthy. We have to make sure they're getting administrative time, so that they can take care of personal items, work items, anything that's not directly related to their immediate training. So, while it's a lot of technical stuff that goes into it, we still have to fit all the other pieces of life in there and make it work week after week for this entire duration. And then you always have something that comes up. I was talking with Alicia earlier: this year, COVID has been a real thing. I mean, that changes everything. It changes our traveling constraints, whether or not we can go to a partner center when we planned on it. If we can't, then we have to try and figure out, how are we going to receive that training that was supposed to be required at that partner center? If we can't do it now and we try to wait until later and hope that we can travel then, then how do we backfill that training time and make it effective, without losing a week of training time? So, it's always tailored to what we need, and then when things come up, we're losing time. So, it seems like you're always trying to make up a little bit of time. And in the grand scheme of things, the idea of handing your life schedule over for a year and a half to two years sounds so intimidating, it's really, still, sometimes not enough time.  Host: Wow.  Crystal Larsen: We're always struggling to get it to work.  Host: Well, let's narrow it down to a day. Crystal, this might be fresh on your mind because you just worked with this increment that just launched. So, do you have a day, maybe in the recent couple of weeks, that maybe stands out to you as this was an absolutely insane day, because the astronauts had to do this, and then they had to do this, and then they had to do this? Is there anyone that sticks out to you just immediately of this most recent increment?  Crystal Larsen: I have seen all sorts of things where I'm a little overwhelmed looking at the schedule for the crew. Obviously, we try to make everything as simple for them as possible. But you might have a day where they wake up early to go fly a T-38. And then afterwards, they have to run to one building on site, which is, of course, away from Ellington, so they need some travel time. And then they might have a class that's off site at the NBL, so they have to travel over there, and then come back to the same facility that they were just at earlier for another training class because of all of our facility constraints and crew member constraints, we couldn't get them back to back. After that, they might have to go get a medical exam, and then go to a physical training class, and then they have another one after that. And maybe we didn't even get a chance to give them a lunch that day. Sometimes, the days just look completely overwhelming. And it can be back to back classes and events for them sometimes. It's a very interesting dynamic to see what their days lay out like on a nominal basis.  Host: Yep. I remember I had just, I got a little bit of a sense of it, because we are part of that flow that you're talking about, Crystal, right, so we get a little bit of studio time with them to record some products, make sure we're sharing their story whenever they actually do go to the space station. I remember one astronaut, she was coming in and she was about to record something with us, but she was in workout attire, and she also had like a little vile of, I think it was either saliva or something, and she was taking samples for human research. And she was shaking the vile. She was like, “hey, where can I,” she was literally shaking the vile saying, “hey, where can I go change?” She had a bag of all kinds of medical equipment because she was taking all these samples for the spaceflight. And I was just like, wait, so you're coming right from like a workout/research study to go right on camera? You know, this is, it was absolutely insane. And I got a little bit of a sense of that. I was like, oh, wow, I think this is, I think this is like every day for them, going back to back doing different things.  Crystal Larsen: It really is. It's really impressive how they maintain such great attitudes, and they're so willing to do whatever is necessary to accomplish the goals. Sometimes you feel bad just saying, “I know you're going to be in workout clothes. I'm going to try and give you five minutes to change.” And they're such troopers about it.  Host: Yes, they really are. I do the same thing because I want to make sure they're comfortable on camera, and so we put them in and we give them the water, we give them a seat. You say, “hey, you know, we've been recording for 45 minutes straight, and you've been talking nonstop. Do you want a sip of water? Do you want to sit down? Do you need to do a bathroom break?” They're like, “nope, let's keep going.” Like almost all of them, it's actually astounding, they're just superhuman beings.  Crystal Larsen: Absolutely.  Host: Alicia, I want to, I want to get a fuller perspective of everything they're doing. So, we're talking about, a lot of the examples that Crystal just gave, especially that one day where they're driving around Houston really, they're going from Ellington Field, they're going to the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, they're going back and forth from the, from the main center. What happens when you have an international aspect of that? Now, travel is getting a little bit more, a little bit more complicated. What happens when you have to start planning for these international trips?  Alicia Robinson: Oh, yeah. And with COVID, as Crystal stated, it has really been a challenge, because for a while there they couldn't even travel internationally. And then we had to, when they were able to travel, we had to use charter or NASA, the NASA plane, or charter flights, to get them there, which added a myriad of constraints with COVID testing, pre- and post-flight testing, and now you're very limited on what days they can actually travel. If we were to talk post-COVID or pre-COVID, when we build our weekly schedules of them having to travel to Russia or Japan or wherever they're going, you give them what we call a travel prep day, or you try to, give them a day before they leave, or sometimes just the morning off, to actually pack. Because just like Crystal said, you're running from building to building, you don't even, they don't even have time to pack and prepare. So, we've pre-negotiated these weeks with the international partners, typically at the beginning of their flight. And we adjust as we need to, but they really, kind of know, in a perfect world, where they're going to be a year from now on, you know, a given week. They actually have all of that laid out for them. So, that is pre-negotiated, but you have to look at the international partners schedule for holidays that they may have in country. You want to avoid those times. You don't send an astronaut to Japan during Golden Week, because no one's working. And vice versa, you don't want to send them here during Christmas week because no one's working here, right? So, that's where we have to sit down, and that's where the international training implementation working group gets together, and we actually have telecons weekly, but we actually try to meet face to face pre-COVID on a quarterly basis, because it takes an entire week to just lay out the crew training template. So, that is how we get the international piece of it. And they bring their requirements. My Japanese counterpart will bring their requirements and say, “we need this crew member for this many weeks. These are the weeks we would like.” We look at it, we go, “oh, can't do those weeks because they have a personal constraint on this side, or I have them in training on this side,” for example, a chamber run, which is extremely difficult to move because of all the pieces involved in getting someone into a chamber, so that's where we do all those international negotiations, is through that working group.  Host: And so, now, we're getting a little bit of insight into what you mean, Alicia, by negotiations. Really, what it sounds like is, everybody's getting together from their respective countries. It sounds like even from, from within NASA, because everybody wants an astronaut's time, and it's up to you to negotiate, no, that person's going to be busy then, or nope, there's going to be a holiday at that time. So, when you say negotiation, that's what you mean, right?  Alicia Robinson: Absolutely. Yep. It's constant negotiations, trading here, trading there. Nope, I can't put so and so in the pool because they have to be in the chamber that day because that's the only day the chamber's open, and I know you want them for this medical research and the blood draw has to happen, but they can't have a blood draw that day because they're underwater, so we need to find a different day for the blood draw. And it's all of those, I don't want to, well, horse trading, I guess you could call it --  Host: Sure, sure, yeah.  Alicia Robinson: -- of their time. And so, it's constant negotiations.  Host: Yeah. See, this is where that criminology background, Alicia, comes into perspective. It seems like that's something you absolutely have to, a skill you have to have, sure, but also have to enjoy if you're doing it that often.  Alicia Robinson: Oh, yes, because it's every day, and it's all day. And so, you have, you have to be very flexible, and you have to think ahead. You have to anticipate. Things happen, like Crystal had alluded to earlier. And then you have natural events. You have the ice apocalypse that we just had in February, where the center was pretty much closed. You have COVID, you have hurricanes, you have tsunamis, you have earthquakes, so you have things happening in other countries where, oh my gosh, we can't send the crew there now because Japan just had an earthquake. Or a volcano erupts, I've had that happen, where I couldn't send people to Russia because the flight path was over, you know, where that volcano had erupted a few years ago. And so, it was like, oh my gosh, now they can't go to Russia, now what do we do. I didn't have anything planned for them in the U.S. I better figure it out. [Laughter]  Host: Wow. See --   Alicia Robinson: You’re not going anywhere any time soon, so let's figure out what you can do while you're here.  Host: Yeah, you're not making me envy the position, Alicia, at all, I mean, that just, like it sounds like Mother Nature can throw things at you. Random scheduling conflicts. I mean, it just seems like that is, that seems like that might be one of the most difficult parts of the job. Not just organizing everything but reacting to the unknown.  Alicia Robinson: Yes. And yeah, throwing a pandemic on top of it.  Host: Yeah.  Alicia Robinson: Boom.  Host: That's right. Crystal, I'm thinking about, you know, all these things we're talking about, right, so there's just things that are just going to happen throughout a training flight. And we said, even that one and a half to two years can get pretty dense with all the activities that have to happen, but the reason that you have to have all of this training is because they have to be prepared for a spaceflight. There are critical milestones, right, that they have to meet before they are, we can call it certified or ready for that flight. So, when we're thinking about all the training thing, all the things that they're training for, what is it that is in the critical path of, they have to make sure they have this training and pass it before they can go on the flight, which is on this date?  Crystal Larsen: So, really, that's kind of identified by what the requirements are for their increment. Based on what the requirements are for their increment, it's determined what level they need to train to for each item. So, if they're planning an EVA during that increment, a nominal planned EVA, then we know we have to have them certified to be able to go out the door safe in a suit, be able to do all the maintenance and perform the mission-specific task at hand. If we know that there's going to be a specific Japanese payload that's new and is going to need a lot of work and we need to train somebody to be able to operate and perform maintenance on that, then we identify all of these items that they have to be trained for. And it's every single system and task and payload that's anticipated during their planned mission. And so, going into this, we know what qualification they need to be trained to, if they're a user or an operator or a specialist. And we need to know what the minimum is for the crew complement. If we have three cosmonauts, if we have one U.S. crew member on the flight, we need to know who's responsible for emergency training; should something off-nominal arise while they're onboard, and we really have to go through, the team as a whole goes through to identify what their qualification levels are, and we actually have a minimum for everything going through. There might be a couple items that you try and work to a higher qualification to, if the time is available, but you might have to, at minimum, be a specialist for emergency training so that you, as the U.S. crew member, can respond to any U.S. emergencies onboard, so that you can maintain safety for the crew. It's really a dynamic matrix that's very increment-specific. And we go through, and those are the minimum qualifications that they have to work on throughout the entire training process.  Host: So, so, we've been talking a lot about the astronauts and their schedule and managing their time. Now, let's follow that path, Crystal, and go behind the scenes to see what you are doing. So, when it comes to project management of an increment, what are some of the things, some of the things that are on your agenda and your responsibilities, what kind of board meetings are you sitting in on, what kinds of tools are you using to manage these, who are you talking to, to make sure that they are certified for this, that, or the other thing? What does your, what does your behind the scenes role look like?  Crystal Larsen: Like we had mentioned earlier, we do work with our international partners who are also responsible for the training at their centers. Like Alicia mentioned, we meet with them once a week just about every week, to talk about crew templates and where they need to be and when. We also work with all of our systems leads for every mission. So, we have a lead for every system, and they're identifying major tasks that need to be accomplished. They're identifying the classes that need to be taken, but then, we also have our chief training officer who is kind of like our right hand. It's the person we work the most with, and they are working with all of the instructors for the crew members. So, while we make all this plan happen, they take this plan and make sure that all the instructors are getting the astronauts as students everything that they need. So, we are having constant conversations with international partners, with instructors, with team leads, every time something needs to be moved or identified, there's a different person you're calling for. [Laughter] Everybody, everybody has really a special item that they work on. And you go to the person who holds all the information for that item in order to make sure that you're meeting all of the requirements that are necessary.  Alicia Robinson: I'd like to throw in one here, if you don't mind, Gary.  Host: Please, please, come in, yeah.  Alicia Robinson: We have to work with each other. The ITIs, we actually have to negotiate with each other, because I only have my crew member in town for two weeks, and I really need them in Building 9 but Crystal is hogging it up because she only has, she has to get her stuff in, and that is probably the most intricate part is that we say, “hey, can I jump in with you then? Can I put my guy or my girl in with you?” You know, we have to work so closely together. We are really, there's five of us, and we are really, really close, have a very, very good, close working relationship. And actually, part of the getting ready process is sitting down, talking to the rest of the ITIs and going, “who has a run on this date or who has a prep and post on this date that I can jump in on?”  Host: So, it seems like even from the beginning, both of you have been in this role for quite some time, right? And so, there's got to be some of those tips and tricks that you've learned throughout the years to know what's important, you know, whenever something comes up, no, I need this, or all, you know, just being in that role for a long time, it sounds like you've, you've learned quite a bit. What are some of those, some of those big lessons that you, that you come into every day when you're about to work on a schedule?  Alicia Robinson: Oh, gosh. The first thing I would say is that you just know that in the end it's going to work out and they're going to be on the rocket. So, you just like, have to take a pause. Even though it seems like you don't have enough time, which we never do, but you sit down, and you just say, “let's look at the efficiencies that we can make.” And that, one of the things is if a class allows for it, there are classes where you can only put one crew member in because it's a phlebotomy class, you know, or something like that, a medical class or a personal BDC (baseline data collection) type event where you have to be just one person, but whenever there's an opportunity to put more than one crew member in an event, that is the first thing we do is we sit down and we say, “how many people can we fit in there?” Now, COVID adds another twist to that, right? So, classes where we used to be able to say, “OK, we could put three, four people in there.” Now because of social distancing, mask guidelines, the comfortability that a crew member has—some crew members, you know, really want more space, you know, between them and other crew members and instructors and things of that nature—so, that, to me, is the biggest thing that we all, all of the ITIs do very well, is that we have to, we sit down, and we look for efficiencies right off the bat. How can we make this fit, because it has to, we have a launch date; and it all has to fit.  Host: So, taking that example, right, let's go into COVID for a little bit, because I think, like you've mentioned, this throws a little bit of a challenge into everything. But here's the thing, is just over the past year that we've had this pandemic, not only has that been a challenge, because you have restrictions on how many people can be in buildings, there's got to be this safety, you know, safety measures of masks and social distancing, put into all of these things. You talked about international travel restrictions. But I think what's really coming at me is, just recently, a lot of these crews have been assigned pretty late. So, when you're talking about, or their mission changes a little bit late. So, when you're talking about this one and a half to two years, right, that, that all of a sudden, it sounds like it may get condensed even, even shorter than that. So, now you have to find, what is the critical path to success, right, to, Alicia, as you said, make, it's going to happen, but how do you get there with all these restrictions coming your way, and a super tight timeline to do it, how have you done it over the past year?  Alicia Robinson: Oh, gosh, yeah, that has been a challenge. And as Crystal mentioned, we do have the training team lead, which is the CTO, the chief training officer, and we usually, we go to them and say, OK, normally these are the minimum qualifications that we need for the increment, and based on the crew members’ experience. So, if you're having all rookies on this flight, and now, they're named late, or the mission has changed, you have to get the instructor team to look at it. So, you have the subject matter expert from each discipline that says, “OK, you know, even though they haven't flown, I've seen this person, for example, in the pool, I know they're really strong here, we can maybe take down the number of required NBL runs, let's do an assessment on their robotic capability and see if we can maybe cut down some classes if they're meeting a certain threshold on their captures.” So, you have to go to the subject matter experts, because we manage all the time, we own all the time internationally and domestically, but they own the content, right? So, we have to make sure that they are going to be able to say yes, I feel with strict confidence this crew is trained on fire, depress, ammonia leaks, and that's how we have to compress the time. So, and, I mean, that's where we start to go in order to compress the time. You have to go to the subject matter experts to get them to look at the crew members’ experience and what they have seen them do in the past, what they know about their skill level and their task level, in order to make reductions. We cannot just make blanket reductions just because they were named late. You have to do it on an individual basis, based on skill at task.  Host: So, Crystal, based on what Alicia is saying, it sounds like, you know, this experience thing, it sounds like that is a big consideration when it comes to fitting some time in for each of these activities into an astronaut schedule. Something I've learned just from my very minimal interactions with astronauts, and I'm curious to hear your perspective, because I feel like you guys are talking and working with astronauts all the time, that's your job, but I also feel like every astronaut is different. Maybe just in terms of personality, maybe in terms of their needs and wants and of certain things. So, how do you fit that also into the schedule of the personality and the traits of an individual that is an astronaut?  Crystal Larsen: You definitely have to approach each individual and their unique preferences. That's a huge consideration. I mean, they are the person we are working for, essentially. We need to serve them and get them qualified. So, they're preferences play a big role in not only our working relationship together throughout this year, but also how we impact their schedule, which impacts their personal life for this entire time training, leading up to spaceflight, which is a big deal for personal, family reasons, all kinds of stuff like that. So, you have some astronauts who will come in and say, you know, “I'm giving you complete authority, I have no constraints, just do whatever you can, and I'm happy with it.” And it makes it really easy. And then you have some people who may have constraints, that doesn't necessarily make it hard, it just means that we have to work around them because it works better for them and makes them happier, makes us happier. Everybody is unique in their preferences and we work to accommodate all of those as best as we can. Some people really like to stay on top of their training programs and know what's coming. Some people, you know, a great example, I just had Mark Vande Hei, he's done it before, and like you mentioned, very recently. So, he was just happy to be training again. “Give me anything. I'm not so worried about what's coming up. I'll handle it when it comes.” And just gracious for all of the opportunities. Everybody has something that works differently for them. And I think about it in terms of we're the same way, you know, I don't know if I could give control of my calendar up to somebody else the way that they do. I don't know that I'd personally be able to handle it. While they may have small preferences in there, ultimately the goal is just to be qualified and prepared and ready to fly.  Host: So, this might be something that is, we're talking about how busy astronauts are, but this might help maybe put it into perspective just a little bit more is, you know, you're talking about, you're talking about managing an astronaut's schedule, and everything they are being asked to do. And even, even some personal items, which I actually do have questions about, but before I get to that, I wanted to ask about just when you're thinking about an astronaut's schedule versus, let's just say, your typical 9 to 5: you get in, you've got an hour lunch, you go home, you make dinner, spend time with your family, you go to bed. What is different when, for an astronaut versus that 9 to 5?  Alicia Robinson: It's not 9 to 5. [Laughter]  Host: There, bingo, right?  Crystal Larsen: Exactly. I mean, we have nominal working hours that we try and schedule them within those hours. However, you might need to fit a T-38 flight in a day with other training classes. So, you may have to start much earlier. Part of the currency requirements for flying are that you have to do night flights. So, we might have to do something like that. You might have a simulation with either an IP (international partner)[astronaut] or somebody in a different state across the country that has a different time zone and we have to adjust things like that. COVID, again, brought another constraint when we weren't able to travel, we did try and do some training remotely. So, then what we had to do was we had to adjust the crew here in Houston onto a schedule for, that matched the Japanese training leave in Japan. So, that way everybody was able to coordinate distance training appropriately. Their schedules vary greatly. It is not as highly dependable as just us coming into work and getting our job done in a normal 9 to 5. We try our best to accommodate that, because we know it's important that they have all of their things outside of work, but it's, the requirements themselves drive lots of variation on that.  Host: And that's where that personal stuff comes in. So, Alicia, now, it sounds like part of the reason that you guys are dealing with that, you know, some of their personal stuff is because their schedules are so tight, and it sounds like even erratic, right? You made the joke that it's not 9 to 5, it's outside, you've got to accommodate based on whatever that training flow is. So, what are those, what are those typical, maybe more common, personal items that you guys are working to fit into their training flow?  Alicia Robinson: Well, one that stands out to me…things as simple as you taking, you know, for granted is a haircut.  Host: Hmm.  Alicia Robinson: I actually have to, we actually have to schedule time for them to get their haircut. And one of the things that I had to do for a flight was I had a crew member who was flying, and they're OK with me saying their names because they say it all the time, but when I had Samantha Cristoforetti on a previous flight, she wanted to make sure one of her crew members could cut her hair appropriately. So, I had to actually send Terry Virts and Samantha to the hairdresser, and I had to coordinate with the hairdresser and make sure I could fit it in, you know, kind of after hours, because they were busy all day, to make sure that he learned how to cut her hair. So, that, that was, you know, just one of the things. But other typical things you have to schedule around is sometimes, you have a crew member who's expecting a baby. You like to try to schedule around the delivery. You have crew members whose kids are getting married, or a crew member themself that's getting married. And you think that that's not common, but it's common and it happens all the time. They want to be a part of their son or daughter's baseball game, basketball game, they want to at least see one. They want to be there. They have kids graduating from high school or college, they want to be there for that. So these are things that you try to schedule around. And one of the things is because we work so far in the future, like Crystal has mentioned, you know, a year and a half, two years in advance, nothing gets done until we put it on the schedule or on a template to show what country they're in. So, by the time an event shows up on a crew member’s schedule for, you know, today, that thing was planned so long ago. You know what I'm saying?  Host: Yeah.  Alicia Robinson: So, it's just, yeah, it's like, you know, people are like, “oh, but can you just move that?” Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, we cannot just move that. We had to fly in people from Huntsville to teach that class. We had to make sure this was available, that was available. Oh, we can't just move that class. [Laughter]  Host: And here I am on a Friday thinking about, huh, I don't know what I'm going to do this weekend, right? And then the astronauts, they already know what they're going to be doing for the next, you know, 17 weekends, whatever it is.  Alicia Robinson: That's absolutely right. Until the ice-pocalypse, or, you know, a pandemic shows up.  Host: Until, yeah, that's right, until something completely unexpected happens. Wow. You know, I think, so what I'm getting from both of you is, you both have been doing this a really long time. And just some of the stories you're telling is just making me think, man, there's got to be a lot of anxiety in this job, right, because things pop up, and you just have to deal with it, but from what I'm getting from both of you is, you both seem just very happy. You know? It seems like there's a good comradery, maybe with the ITI team, maybe with the astronauts as well. What's it like, your culture, just working with the astronauts? Crystal, I'll go over to you first.  Crystal Larsen: I think it's easy for us to all remember every day that we're blessed to be able to do this job. We're blessed to be working in this position where we get to work with the astronauts. We get to be a part of such an integral part of spaceflight. We get to watch it all firsthand. There's such an emotional attachment, maybe not even to the astronauts that we're assigned to, but I might be attached to Alicia's crew members and any of my other crew members that I just see in the hall every day when it's their time to launch. You're very emotionally attached to the mission and the job and it's very special, a very special thing to be a part of. And I think none of us lose that, even when it gets busy and overwhelming. The job is all about being prepared to handle all the things that don't go according to plan, which is ironic considering we plan for a living. You know, you know it's not going to go according to plan always, and it's just, you do the next right thing, you make it work. I think having great team members and such an amazing group of people as a whole in the crew office is really kind of what keeps our spirits up all the time.  Host: Alicia, you, well, you both actually have mentioned how long you've been in this position; you've been doing this for a number of years, and you've seen several programs throughout it, right? So, we're talking shuttle and then it's mostly Soyuz, now we're getting commercial crew into the mix. What have you seen in terms of the evolution of your own role and how it's changed with just being maybe more NASA-focused, to bringing a more international and maintenance schedule into it, to now working with commercial companies?  Alicia Robinson: I'm so glad you actually mentioned that because I was sitting here thinking, as Crystal was talking, that the astronaut corps, they are, they're amazing people, right? They're the best of the best. And I get to work with them, you know, daily. You get to know them on a personal level. You get to know their families. And by knowing their families and just being so connected to them, you feel a personal sense of responsibility, not only for the mission, but for their personal happiness and growth, right? And so, now you throw in these international astronauts, you know? I'm so honored that I've had the opportunity to work closely with cosmonauts, you know, for so many years, you know, something I never thought growing up that I would travel to Russia, and, you know, just walk around Red Square, you know, how amazing is that. And when I look at the state of the world and the, you know, some of the challenges we have, I look at the International Space Station as just this wonderful piece of unity in a kind of chaotic world, right? And I worked the shuttle program, I had three shuttle flights. And then, but mainly been an ISS worker. And just seeing all of that, and it just brings, for me, this sense of great pride. And the other ladies that I work with, the other three ITIs, are amazing. And we've worked together for many years. And we know each other so well that we can almost finish each other's sentences. Same with the international partners that we work with. This team, you know, I've worked with my Russian counterpart for probably 18 years, you know, I've been to their homes. They've been to our homes, you know? It's just this wonderful feeling of having this comradery. And then now with the commercial partners, you know, it's another sense of pride for me, you know, being here in the U.S., seeing our crew members and the partners launching from the U.S. again. So, that is just one of the things that I just love about the evolution of spaceflight. And then we're going to be going back to the Moon and onto Mars. I mean, it's just something that, with all of the challenges we have, I wouldn't trade it for anything because I'm not going to get this in any other, I'm not going to get this sense of accomplishment and this sense of pride anywhere else.  Host: I love the sense of passion, Alicia. And building off of that, Crystal, you know, just, exactly what Alicia just said, just seeing this progression and just being embedded in NASA culture and in international suite of all of these talented people that help to make the mission possible, thinking about those next steps, Alicia mentioned Artemis, right, so we went all through to working with commercial crew today, that next step is you guys are going to be helping out the astronauts train for putting the footprints of the first woman, next man, on the Moon. That's going to be your job is making sure that they are ready for that mission. What do you think about whenever you think that, man, this is, this is coming up soon?  Crystal Larsen: It's really one of those things that kind of gives you goosebumps. It's surreal at the same time; it's very exciting. We don't know what all that's going to entail yet for our job. It's a little too soon for that all to be defined for us. But it is something that we are so looking forward to. Again, the sense of pride, even though this isn't something we're putting into action yet, we're all just beaming with excitement waiting for this to happen.  Host: Well, I've very much enjoyed this conversation with both of you today. I think, not only did I learn so much about what you, what you do, I really didn't fully understand what it takes to organize an astronaut's schedule, but I think, I think one of the best takeaways, for me at least, was hearing both of you and how passionate you are about this job. So, Alicia and Crystal, thank you both for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. It's been an absolute pleasure.  Alicia Robinson: Oh, it's been my pleasure. Thank you so much. This, it's just a wonderful opportunity. And this is one of those great things with technology. We get to do this and we get to, you know, hopefully inspire some other people to come up in the ranks and say, “hey, I want to work at NASA, but I don't, I didn't know that there was a position for me if I wasn't an engineer,” so I hope it inspires someone today.  Crystal Larsen: Absolutely. It was a pleasure to be here.  Host: Thanks to you both. Take care.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I hope you enjoyed our conversation with Alicia Robinson and Crystal Larsen. I definitely enjoyed it, learned a lot, and I hope you felt the passion from the work that they do as much as I did.

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 91, The Hero's Behind the Hero's Part 4. I'm Pat Ryan today we're posting the last episode of our series telling the amazing story of the rescue of the audio from NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston during the Apollo 11 mission that landed the first Americans on the moon. The earlier episodes recount the tale of Dr. John Hanson's intent to use that audio for his academic research in communications and speech processing, and how he and his team ran into one hardware issue after another that threatened the whole project, but as Hansen said at the end of Episode 3, his teams determination to succeed was similar to NASA's attitude when it was trying to meet President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon.  John Hansen: We set a goal and we may not have had all the answers at that instant when we set the goal, but people worked collaboratively together to insure that they're going to achieve that, so this was something that we've tried to inspire the students that were all involved with this, with that mindset.  Host: When we left our hero's last time, they had finished digitizing nineteen thousand hours of audio from a Apollo 11 and some other missions of the era, but their job wasn't done, and so neither is our story. Let's jump back in and find out what happens next. Here we go.  [Music]  Who can forget this classic opening line, “Wee, sleekit, cowrin’, tim’rous beastie”? Okay, maybe most people forgot it, but probably most people know this line, that's just from a little bit further down in the Robert Burns poem To a Mouse, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley\" Well, John Hansen can attest to the truth of that statement.  [Music]  The University of Texas of Dallas Professor, who is the universities distinguished Chair in Telecommunications Engineering and the founder and Director of the Center for Robust Speech Systems, he had a plan, he and his team of students were going to salvage the audio recorded in NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston during the first a Apollo moon landing and do a comprehensive study of the language used by a large group of people while they were collaborating to solve a problem. The researchers were going to advance speech and language technology by developing the mechanical systems that could better understand the jumble of human speech, as compared to a single voice. Their plan did not include solving a major engineering problem to get the only available piece of hardware that could possibly play the audio off of analog tapes, get that equipment into operating condition so that they can digitize these sounds of history. Completely off plan, they designed and fabricated brand new hardware components. And then they oversaw the playback of more than sixty audio tapes running some, fourteen hours each, just to get the raw material with which to do the science they came here to do in the first place.   [Music]  John Hansen: Yeah, we had nineteen thousand hours probably in the neighborhood of about twelve terabytes of data, and like anything, that's a lot of data and if you say, okay, we've now digitized it, if I threw that over the fence at you and said, here's the data, you'd say, well, that's great, it's too much, don't know what to do with it, don't know how to actually interpret it or use it in anyway, so that's where—and fortunately, the process of actually building the solution and digitizing it, this was an engineering challenge, but it was something that was basically you could think of as, like, a task, something that had to be done. During this entire process we weren't, kind of, just waiting around, waiting for audio to be available, we had students and researchers focused on developing the technologies to be ready when the audio had been digitized, and so those algorithms, the basic strategic is referred to as diarization. Normally we, think, well, if you've got the audio, just feed it through a speech recognition system and you look, for example at smartphones, you could look at Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri and say, well, I've got speech recognition, why can't I take this audio and feed it through Alexa or feed it through, you know, Siri?  Host: Why couldn't you.  John Hansen: And the answer is because NASA speaks in acronyms.   AFD: Science, AFD  Science: Go ahead.  AFD: Hey where are you getting your ESAP pointing data?  Science: I’m getting it from the CM  AFD: No I’m talking about the—does either the LEM or the CSM PSAP have a ESAP performance in it?  John Hansen: And those acronyms are not there simply to, kind of, make things sound more technical, it's because NASA was trying to accomplish, you know, the bulk of the command and control here through audio communication. So if you could say something, you know, in one or two seconds that may have taken three to five seconds to speak, well now you've opened up that channel for someone else to talk, and so acronyms were used to primarily to try and be more efficient. The problem is when you look at any commercial base speech recognition technology out there, none of them, absolutely none of them are set up for the type of NASA vocabulary that's used, that's one and two; virtually all speech technology that's out there is intended for one person giving a voice command or saying something to a machine, in all the communication here, none of this was intended to be used for speech technology, it was people talking with each other to solve a problem, so it's natural, spontaneous speech and the speaking style that we have here is dramatically different than if you're actually speaking to Alexa or Siri, there's lots of coarticulation effects and what that means is, you know, if you looked at printed material, if you saw the phrase, \"cats an dogs each hate the other\" well, if you listen to me carefully, I actually did not say what was actually printed, if it was written there, because I said, \"cats an dogs\" the arrested A N, not A N D so if I were actually saying it the way I should have been, it should have been cats and dogs, but we don't speak that way, and so because of that, the speech recognition technology has to interpret from the audio what would be an appropriate text sequence, and so that requires a dictionary or a Lexicon and it also requires a very effective language model that predicts what word might come over a given word.  Host: Your ability to tell the—to give the computer a hint about the language that's being used?  John Hansen: Exactly, yeah. So when I mention this diarization, well, when you look at any mission for Apollo, they're typically six to eight days long, thirty channels, you also have to think every NASA mission specialist in the Mission Control Center, they're not working the entire hundred and, you know, sixty eight or hundred seventy hours straight, right? So you're going to have typically three or four people that are taking shifts, working an eight hour shift, maybe overlapping by one hour between     Host: At one of those consuls in the flight control room there are, there's a team.  John Hansen: Yes.  Host: In rotation.  John Hansen: So that means that for an eight hour period we typically would have one person responsible for whatever that loop would represent, and so by the digitizing process, now we want to actually go through and do diarization. So that task first requires that we run something called, \"Speech Activity Detection\" we want to identify where there's silence and when there's speech; the reason for that is if there's silence, you really want to turn off the speech recognizer. If no one is talking, you don't want the recognizer listening in because it'll start spitting out words if there's some noise or some other distortion that might appear on that, so now you have spurious words popping up and that's not a good thing. So speech activity detection is done first, after that, you've identified blocks which represent speech, and then you feed only those portions into speech recognition, maybe before you do the speech recognition you actually might do what's called, \"Speaker Clustering\" and the reason for that is when you're looking at a loop, you typically have two people talking to each other, so you really would like to actually identify the turns, if PAO is speaking—oh, let's not—let's say, flight director, so flight director is speaking and he's trying to get information about flight dynamics or something like that.  FDO: Flight, it’s FDO  Flight Director: Go ahead  FDO: In the interest of science it would behoove us at this time to take a checkpoint.  Flight Director: Let me check our associates. EECOM?  EECOM: Stand by one.  Flight Director: How about you GNC whenever we get over this present stumbling block?  EECOM: Okay Flight, we’re go.  Flight Director: FDO?  FDO: We’ll get some cooperation.  John Hansen: So he asks a question and then that person responds, so there's turn taking going on, so we want to identify is it speaker A, speaker B, speaker A, speaker B? And then after that when we run speech recognition we at least have an idea that there's turns taking place here.  Host: So that it can tell the difference—that there are different persons?  John Hansen: Yes, that there are two people that are talking to each other, yes. So in order to build the speech recognizer, you've got to understand that we now need to migrate the technologies that we've worked on for more than twenty five years at our center, to something that would work for NASA speak, if you want to call it that. And so one of the things we needed to do is first to get a Lexicon, a dictionary of all the expresses that NASA would use and then build a language model. To do that, we went and we pulled every document about Apollo that we could find, books, news, releases, everything we could find, we pulled a total of 4.2 billion words in order to build our Lexicon and to build our language model. So the Lexicon, you know, the English language has about six hundred thousand words, okay? If you threw some of NASA's expressions in there you might add a few more than six hundred thousand, I guess, but most vocabulary systems, when you're doing speech recognition are typically a hundred thousand to maybe a hundred and forty, hundred fifty thousand words is typically what you would see. So we built up the dictionary, or Lexicon. What that Lexicon actually is it's got the word that the person would have said and it's has the actual sounds that would make up that word, those sounds are called phonemes.  Host: So that when it hears those sounds     John Hansen: It's going to replace it with the text of the words.  Host: It knows what the word is.  John Hansen: Yes.   Flight Director: Ahh yeah, why don’t you just keep on going through it. I’m going around for T2 stay/no stay, all flight controllers. T2 stay/no stay. RETRO?  RETRO: Stay.  Flight Director: FDO?  FDO: Stay.  Flight Director: Guidance?  Guidance: Stay.  Flight Director: CONTROL?  CONTROL: Stay.  Flight Director: Telcom?  Telcom: Stay.  [ Unintelligible ]  Flight Director: EECOM?  EECOM: Stay.  Flight Director: Surgeon?  Surgeon: Stay.   Flight Director:  Capcom we’re stay for T2.  Capcom: Eagle, Houston you’re stay for T2. Over.  Neil Armstrong: Roger, stay for T2. We thank you.  Capcom: Roger, sir.  [Music]  Host: Lakshmish Kaushik was working as a speech scientist in Montreal when he learned through academic circles about John Hansen's project and was intrigued. He was interested because he knew Hansen's reputation and recognized the research significance of the project and he was struck at the prospect of working with NASA, so he left his job and enrolled at the University Texas at Dallas as a PhD candidate working with Hansen on the a Apollo tapes project. It was his job to build the speech recognition system that could turn the digitized audio of the Apollo Mission Control Center Team into text.  Lakshmish Kaushik: Say, for example, if I say “okay eagle,” so it will try to understand, o-k e-g-le, it will try to separate it into its individual compliments and then try to identify the most basic phonetic composition of the audio. After it finds the most probable phonetic composition of the audio, these units are sent through the language models, which I described earlier, which will try to decode and pose the possible sentences and the words using the phonetic structure out of phonemes that have been decoded by the linguistic models.  Host: At that point, are you, like, playing one conversation at a time to it to put it together? Or do you already get to—are you at a point where you can play at the multiple conversations that were happening at the same time on different tracks and having it sort those out?  Lakshmish Kaushik: No, those things are done in uh, parallelly like, you know we have totally thirty channels in a single—in loop track, and then we have thirty separate audio files, once the system is built by the trans cable system which predicts the speech and then convert it into text, we had an enormous, huge cluster of computers which can convert speech to text parallelly, so we parallelly started this transcription system running across almost around like, running parallelly on fifty computers at the same time.  Host: Fifty?  Lakshmish Kaushik: So we had—  Host: Five zero?  Lakshmish Kaushik: Yes.  Host: Fifty computers?  Lakshmish Kaushik: Yes.  Host: Wow.  Lakshmish Kaushik: It'd be like something called a GP rack, which had almost around ten GPU's which are very computationally, if we share, which can do millions and millions of computation every second and it had more than a hundred EPU processors, which can crunch the data at a blazing speed, so we used this kind of cluster to convert this speech to text. And mind it, we had nineteen thousand hours of data and this conversion is almost real time. So that means that, okay, if I give them seconds of data, it takes to almost around eight to nine seconds to convert it into text. So in order to convert nineteen thousand hours of data, we had to run more than fifty to a hundred parallel threads at the same time to transcribe the nineteen thousand hours of data, this conversion itself took almost around four to five months.  Host: Yup. That's what he said; it took four to five months with fifty computers crunching data to generate transcripts of the Mission Control conversations with timestamps to indicate when things were said. That facilitated the researchers work with this trove of audio, just as it will help you when you go to the website where you can read the transcripts and listen to the audio yourself, I'll give you the web address in a few minutes. It also turns out that the transcripts sped up the ability of the NASA Export Control Office to review the all the material to approve its release to the public.  Karen Walseman: My name's Karen Walseman, I work on the JSC Export Services Team.  Host: Which is also known as Export Control. So what is Export Control and why does anything need to have its export controlled?  Karen Walseman: That's an excellent question and one that the JSC Export Services Team and myself and Headquarters and everybody in Export Control would really like to make known, it's really a twofold thing. The first thing people think about is missiles, you know, you want to control technology so that people can't get the technology that they have  that we have that can then be turned on us and hurt us, missile technology. The other thing is to maintain our excellent superiority in some places where we really have the majority of the knowledge, like in engine design, and so we help when we get with Rocketdyne, Aerojet and these guys and they help us with our engines and provide us with engines, we protect that technology for them and we don't let that stuff get out unless somebody actually has a need to see it and we have a requirement to send it to them. So we're protecting, you know, U.S technology, as well as protecting our safety from, you know, bad people overseas.  Host: I guess that you're trying to protect this information from being released either intentionally or accidentally.  Karen Walseman: Yes; and a lot of people don't realize that you and I sitting here, carrying on this discussion, I could release technology, or data into the public dominion that was not ever intended to be released into the public dominion.  Host: Your conversation--  Karen Walseman: Right.  Host: Might release information.  Karen Walseman: And so if we have this discussion and it contains ITAR or EAR controlled information, and then you put it out on the web, there it goes, it's in the public.  Host: Okay. And those acronyms are for laws that are regulate, the release of such information, right?  Karen Walseman: Those are the two laws, the ITAR is the International Traffic and Arms Regulations, and that's controlled by the Department of State, they're more military based. The EAR is the Export Administration Regulations, and that's controlled by the Department of Commerce and they're more business based, but there is a lot of technology and missile type technology that is in the EAR controlled by Commerce, space station, for example is controlled by the Department of Commerce. The Orion vehicle itself is controlled by the Department of Commerce.  Host: Karen Walseman started working at NASA in 1989, during the Return to Flight Effort after the loss of Space Shuttle Challenger, she's worked in the mission control back rooms on the Robotics Flight Control Team, she's trained space shuttle astronauts, and designed simulators for astronaut training and has worked on the Orion Program, so she brought a wide range of knowledge of work done at the Johnson Space Center when they joined Export Control and her boss thought she was a natural for this assignment.  Karen Walseman: So the Export Services Team was contacted and our Center Export Administrator Ari Blum, said, well, Karen can do that, she knows about older programs; and so I met with everybody and tried to get a handle on what was needed and required and we started exchanging information, and that's how it started.  Host: At this point do you think that you're looking at just reviewing historical information, or are you still concerned about technology? I'll be it, fifty year old he technology.  Karen Walseman: Yeah, it's fifty year old technology, but it's still how to maneuver in space, it's still engines, you know, we're firing engines and we're guidance is a big deal, we're using guidance and navigation and how to control where you're going from point A, to point B in space, and those things are technologies that are controlled by Export Control. The thing I was looking for though was any very deep details of discussions that could be considered technical data and something we would not want to be transmitted out over the waves and into the public.  Host: Can you give me without spilling the technological beans; can you give me an example of what kind of a conversation you were thinking of that might be present?  Karen Walseman: Yeah, the biggest thing you're looking for is when there's a problem because when you have a malfunction of some kind, then the engineers start talking in very deep detail about how the hardware that failed was designed, and what it was intended to do, and then what it ended up doing and that's called anomaly resolution and many times, even when we get licenses to provide support to our international partners, we're still not allowed to them with anomaly resolution and because that will then teach them how to fix their own problems when they have a problem with their hardware in the future, and so you kind of look for those kind of in depth discussions for an anomaly resolution or design discussions on how a piece of hardware was designed, but in verbal conversations it's very hard to get all of that through without having the hardcopy data that they're looking at to go through it.  Host: When you say it's hard in a verbal conversation to get that information through, the through part is throwing me, are you talking about to get any cleared through an Export Control review or to get it conveyed to the person to whom you're speaking?  Karen Walseman: Conveyed to the person to whom you're speaking without having a written document in front of them as well as reference.  Host: That the two of you are looking at and, you know referencing?  Karen Walseman: And then carrying on a discussion about.  Host: I see.  Karen Walseman: That's the better way to put that.  Host: So merely, a conversation between these two people—some two people without, absent the document they are referencing to is less likely to contain anything that you would    that you don't want to be released?  Karen Walseman: That's correct, and sometimes that's not the case, you know, they're really good at explaining things, but the majority of the time they're just talking numbers, and unless you're really good at what you're listening to, it's just a lot of numbers.  Host: Or maybe if you don't— if you already have some detailed knowledge, you would understand what those numbers mean.  Karen Walseman: And there is a lot of detailed knowledge about the Apollo program already out there.  Host: And because it's been out for so long, right?  Karen Walseman: Right; and we didn't have the controls at the end of the a Apollo program on technology that we do today, the details, and so everybody was all excited about the technology that we had back in the early 70s when everything was winding down and they were all excited about building rockets and showing how the engines worked and all those good things, and so there's just a lot of technical data out on the Internet, it's easy to find.  Host: Hansen and some of his students had described to me that they had digitized nineteen thousand hours of conversations, which then is coming to your desk? What kind of plan do you come up with to try to wade through that mountain of material?  Karen Walseman: My plan was simple, I chose what I considered the three biggies, they started with Apollo 11, of course, what an exciting thing to listen to over and over again. I mean, I listened to the entire mission of Apollo 11, I pick out bits and pieces of other missions that, where I knew they were an anomalies and where they were in the—would be in the recordings to listen to those, and then based upon that level of detail, we extrapolated an Export Control decision for the entire set without listening to the entire set.  Host: Okay. You didn't have to listen to all nineteen thousand hours?  Karen Walseman: I think my child would have to had carried on I my legacy for doing that too, I don't think I have nineteen thousand hours in my world [laughter]  Host: Did you—did either Hansen and his team or the technical people who helped digitized that in the Public Affairs Office, did they give you some assistance or some means of helping get through the material?  Karen Walseman: Hansen's team broke it all down into snippets of recordings and then they ran it through a piece of software that would listen to the recording and write down a transcript of it.  John Hansen: In order for NASA Export Control to actually go through and approve the release of this, when we first started talking NASA Export Control, their original approach was, well, we need to listen to this, and we said, well, okay but this is nineteen thousand hours, you can't listen to nineteen thousand hours. So how do we speed this up? So that was a new problem we had—we looked at. So we decided well, let's try to streamline this, we were motivated to try and make it easier for the Export Control Specialist to be able to go through this quickly. So we set up a process where once the transcripts were generated and the audio is there, we automatically populated an XL file and in the XL file we have one row that basically just has the text transcript of what's in that fifteen minute block, and so the person from Export Control could just read what they see in that text block, if they're unsure of what was being said or they have some concern, in the next cell there's a direct link, and they can just click and when they click that link, there's a system called Transcriber, LBC Transcriber tool that pops up, has the wave form, has the text transcript, and all of the links that put the texts directly with the audio, so now they can just click this little highlighted spot that they're looking at in the XL file and just listen to that, you know, one to three second, five second block. So it really sped up the export control process.  In one month NASA Export Control was able to approve one thousand hours of audio, and otherwise they would have had to listen to all of that, so they listened to a fraction of it. In addition to that, we were really appreciative that NASA Export Control also went and started doing a lot of the, I would say, the improvements of the transcripts because when you run speech recognition, it's not going to be flawless, there’s going to be some errors and so the NASA Export Control Specialist actually made some text comments and corrections there, but also had a field there that said, well, this spot is particularly important for this reason, so she inserted some comments there that were really helpful for an archiving purpose.  Host: Were there things you found that you had to cut out that you said no, you can't release this?  Karen Walseman: It mostly had to do with personal information, you know, they call it PII, Personally Identifiable Information because people were handing out phone numbers, not like they're valid anymore.  Host: Sure, they're probably not.  Karen Walseman: And I said, you probably really don't want to do that.  Host: So in all of that, you didn't really find anything substantial or technology releases that, you know, technological information that needed to be protected.  Karen Walseman: Not really, no.  Host: Did you find anything in there that you found really interesting, really fascinating, things you didn't know before?  Karen Walseman: Yeah, that there's a place in Clear Lake back in 1968-69 called the Chicken House and you can get a sandwich, a french fry and a Coke for a buck sixty five.  Host: Wow, we should go there for lunch now, huh?  Karen Walseman: I don't know where the Chicken House is, but every time they were going for lunch or dinner it was, there were only three options and it was the Chicken House and some German restaurant and a burger joint and that was it, that's the only three they ever came up with.   Voice 1:  Go ahead, Network.  Network: Hey, is that the one, the party, the splashdown party down at the Hofbrau Garden back in the back, Thursday?   Voice 1:  Alright I understand they gonna block off NASA 1 at Webster.  Host: How do you think of this job, in comparison to the other kinds of jobs that you did, was this special? More interesting? More important?  Karen Walseman: It was special and because I grew up in Titusville during the Apollo program.  Host: Oh.  Karen Walseman: My dad was a contractor at the Kennedy Space Center at the time. So, to me, it was very near and dear to my heart to hear all of these things and see all of these things because I got to watch these launches from my backyard or sometimes from the bleachers outside of the Launch Control Center, and so to come back as an adult all these years later and listen to these men and a couple of women go through all of this, was fascinating, absolutely fascinating and my brother is an Apollo nut and so this—I would send him little emails going, you're not going to believe it, when it's released I can tell you.   [Laughter]   Voice 2: Powered flight angle 10 decimal 3822; that is a change. Powered flight burn time 444 seconds. Altitude at insertion 60 thousand feet. Velocity at insertion 5535 decimal zero.  Host: Karen Walseman's review of the mountain of material led to Export Control approval for public release of the Apollo 11 Mission Control tapes and transcripts and that meant two things; the first thing is John Hansen and his team could use it in their academic research and I'll get Tatiana Korelsky from the National Science Foundation comment on the quality of that work.   [Music]  Tatiana Korelsky: It was a very interesting development which was never even anticipated before. They decided to use the technology to identify sentiment, to identify negative and positive statements because they were so certain exchanges in those Apollo tapes were so emotional, they were events happening in real time. So people were sometimes upset, sometimes were elated.   Voice 3: [Inaudible] for voice check.  Voice 2: Well good morning.  Voice 3: Ah it’s the man.  Voice 2: It is him.  Voice 3: What have you been up to?  Voice 2: Not much at my age.  Voice 3: Come on. I don’t believe it.  [Laughter]  Tatiana Korelsky: And it was great material to use technology, which is—actually they had to push the technology, because as you maybe understand, to understand emotion you only—you don't only use words, you also use what we call, prosody, it's the intonation contour of speech, it's either high pitch as when people are excited, or it's so—this prosodic analysis was also done, so that was in addition to what they proposed to do and to tell you, quite frankly, it's unbelievable what they accomplished. On a small award, it was a small award five hundred thousand dollars for three years and it's totally amazing to us now what they have achieved on that small small award.  Host: The research that they able to do after they solved the engineering problem of getting the material off the tapes, did it—maybe it's too soon to know, maybe the research isn't over, but did they learn the things they set out to learn?  Tatiana Korelsky: Yes, they did, and not only that, they published many, many papers in the best international conferences, which to us, in itself, proves the quality of their research because if they are—all these papers are usually peer review, very very stringently, you know, and the fact that they were able to publish, at the best conferences, actually, and many papers, just tells us about the quality of the research.  Host: And I to want make sure that we understand what the ultimate goal is here, all of this is leading you to develop these language models and through the use of this raw material that you got from NASA, to create, what?  John Hansen: We wanted the text transcript, but we wanted the transcript that actually had for all the audio, we wanted to have the exact time when the speech was produced, we wanted to at least understand that there were turns they were taking between speakers and we wanted to be able to synchronize that across the multiple channels. So think of this as, kind of, like doing the reverse of an audio recording from a symphony, you have, you know, thirty tracks of different instruments playing, you want to digitize each of those individually, you then you want to kind of understand the score of what each instrument is actually playing, and then you wanted to be able to look across these different tracks to understand how are these different sounds across these different instruments working together. Likewise, for NASA, how are each of these different channels and the people on each of these loops solving a particular problem and how does it affect people in another loop.  Host: And that's what was happening in the example that you used, but you're using that to develop technology that could be used in what way?  John Hansen: Yeah, so by advancing the speech technology, moving speech recognition out of simply just saying, well, I've got one person reading prompted text, let's say for a news broadcast for TV or radio, to someone speaking spontaneously. Moving away from a single person talking, to groups of people talking collaboratively together. The technology that exists for, you know, the first part there, that's been developed over the last, maybe, thirty or forty years. The technology for looking at multiple people talking collaboratively, people have been working on that, but it's a very small portion of the actual research that’s been accomplished and the reason is because there really are no corpora available for the community to use. This will be the standard corpus that the speech and language community uses to look at collaborative multispeaker type engagement for solving problems. The real huge plus here is that these are people solving a real problem, you know, one would argue that the most challenging engineering problem mankind has seen. But also these are natural voices that were being recorded. All the microphones were known, you know, everything was digitized with a particular time code on there. You know, this is the best one could ever hope for, you know, no one would ever think if there's a natural disaster wait, let's actually record everyone who's going speak and let's make sure we synchronize all the audio, it'll never happen. So this really is a very rare, but a unique opportunity that NASA has allowed the speech and language community to have access to, and it really will be a game changer. It will ultimately contribute to better understanding of how people work together in teams. You could imagine the Army or the military would to want know this, you could imagine anyone dealing with natural disasters who would want to understand this and they're going to take the lead and their experience coming directly from how NASA works as a team and that's, to me, a very, very, good reason why NASA represents, kind of a, you know, a primary example of actually how other organizations should work collaboratively together, it's not a pitch for NASA, but it's really what we see from the audio from here.  Host: Now, the second that resulted from Export Control clearing the Apollo 11 audio for use and release, is that Hansen and his team had a go to publish so you and I could listen to it too. It's all online at the website: ExploreApollo.org  John Hansen: We're an academic institution so we're making all the data available.  Host: Where, where, where? If I wanted to go scan it, listen to some of it, where would I go?  John Hansen: So we have a website that you can get access to and it has some of the audio examples there, we had undergraduate students working on this for probably—well, we had several different teams working on this for maybe four years, working on this. One of the spots on the Explore Apollo website, students wanted to—we had like different stories. We said, well, you can't just start playing this, no one wants to listen to the whole thing. So you have to have bite size chucks that would be appropriate. The students starting developing those things, and then we test drove those little stories at the Perot Museum during Engineers Week. Having kids that are, you know, from first grade up to eighth grade kind of listening to it. We got their feedback. We had other, there's another, a group on campus called SEEC, The Science Engineering Education Center, Russell Hulse our Nobel Prize Laureate at UTD oversees that, and so we had that group also review some of the stories and things. So we have small bite size chucks, so to speak, on the explore Apollo type website that we set up. Students wanted to have something that would be like random, so there's a little button that you could say, \"surprise me\" and it would randomly put you into some spot during the mission that you could kind of listen to, which is an interesting thing. I had to remind the students, look, nothing gets NASA engineers more nervous than the word surprise me, so I said, you've got to be careful when you do that, but it was good.   FDO: Network, FDO.  Network: Go ahead FDO.  FDO: Ed?  Network: Yeah.  FDO: [Inaudible] You know that sheet of paper? LLS determination, you know, where you fill in and do all your computation? Right after touchdown.  Network: Yeah you’d like one?  FDO: Yeah would you—no I got one, but I never did get one all filled in ‘cause we had so much trouble right after descent. Would you have one of the math aides copy that and send it to me down the P-tube.  Tatiana Korelsky: The site is very nice, it's very nice, I actually, preparing for this interview, I went and I used the site a little bit. The site has stories about what's happening on this Apollo tape, you can click and you hear the conversation and you see the running transcript, which is automatically recognized, it's a very, very, nice site for the public, and especially, and for younger generation. They I think also that this website, although that Hansen might tell you in more detail, that some variant of it was also installed in the Perot Museum of Science, but that is another thing. For kids, it was just really fascinating because they can browse these tapes and see exactly what was said, and who, you know, who is talking, like commanders and the Control Center, very, very, interesting.   INCO: Capcom, INCO.  Capcom: Go ahead.  INCO: I was just looking on page 3-55 and they got a picture of the spacecraft, the angle to the sun, and the attitude of the spacecraft. And it looks like to me about 90 degrees on that day.   Capcom: That was 15 hours of—  Host: Greg Wiseman, the audio engineer at JSC who helped John Hansen and his team digitize the audio for their project and helped post the audio online.  Greg Wiseman: And so now we have it uploaded in bulk to archive.org making it available for anyone who wants it. And since we've released it, I've been in contact with some documentary filmmakers who are taking this audio and they're synchronizing it with some recently discovered seventy millimeter film that was shot in the Mission Control room during landing, which is really exciting because for the first time that film will have an audio component, they didn't record audio originally with the film, but, of course, NASA was recording the audio loops, so they were able to take our recordings and lip sync it with this film, because a lot of the film was shooting fight controllers, so they've got the film and now they've got their audio; and it's really amazing, it's amazing the work that those folks were able to do resyncing all of this. So all of these things are coming together at the same time. I think it's going to provide a new perspective and insight into Apollo 11 and I think, as we get closer to the anniversary of the moon landing, with the release of all this new material, it's really going to propel this monumental event back into the forefront public consciousness.  John Hansen: We've distributed, I think, a few of these to a couple of different groups. There's one group that's developing a movie for CNN and an IMAX movie using some of this audio, I think, yeah. So one of the interesting challenges from that effort this one company, NASA had a videographer that would walk around with a video camera and actually videotape, you know, Mission Control space, people, working and stuff, but the video recorder was actually just video, it didn't have any audio, so they had these silent films of all these people. They may take, you know, five seconds or ten seconds of video here and then they'd go somewhere else and take five or ten seconds. So all that video is actually available, this one company had access to it, but they have any audio, but they could see someone was talking, you know, on their headset, so they were trying to read the lips, and look to see, okay, we think they said this and then they would try to go back and see—  Host: Search.  John Hansen: Search and find that, but they weren't being too successful, so they reached out to NASA, I think, Greg Wiseman they contacted, and Greg said, well, go find John Hansen up there in Dallas and maybe he can help you out. So we talked with them, and we sent them—we got permission from NASA, but we sent them the full material for Apollo 11 and then Apollo 13, and the way I see is it they're basically playing Frankenstein. What they're doing is they're using video that was recorded from a silent video camera, and they're linking that to audio that we digitized, you know, forty eight years later, and stitching them together, and it's really cool because there's some examples where you're listening to an audio, which is the audio that we pull up, and every once in a while you'll see a video portion of the person actually speaking and then it just goes to audio again, and so what they've done is they've just stitched this video and connected it to the audio. And it's really interesting because it gives you, like, a window into what Mission Control space actually looked like when they were talking. When we, kind of, had some of these news releases, we started getting contacted by, you know, someone saying, yeah, my father worked for NASA or my next door neighbor, he worked for NASA; and so right now one of my students is actually doing something called, \"Finding Waldo\" if you know what Waldo is, you'd find a picture of him. So someone will say, yeah, my uncle or my grandfather or my father worked for NASA so we asked them, well, can you send me a picture of what he looked like at that time and what he looks like now. And what we're going to do is we're going to go back and we're going to actually go back and we're going to actually go across all nineteen thousand hours and try to find examples of when that person spoke and then on our archive, we're going to have their picture and then we're going to have a little, you know, folder with all of the audio clips that that person spoke. So now someone will be able to actually say, hey, my grandfather worked at NASA, here are examples of him talking to Neil Ar—well, he had to be Capcom if he was talking to the Neil Armstrong—but here is, you know, him talking with other specialists at NASA at the time, and so this actually, we hope will show a little bit about the people that worked behind the scenes that really are, kind of, like the unsung heroes that made sure that everything was going to be successful. Very much true in Apollo 11. Apollo 13 was probably NASA's one of the biggest accomplishments they were able to achieve, you know, at least when I looking at Apollo, so we're kind of happy this notion of the heroes behind the heroes, we think it's something that rings true.  Host: They're going to kick us out of here, this has been terrific.  John Hansen: All right let's go. Let me make one more statement.  Host: Yes.  John Hansen: So one of the—you might ask, well, why would we to want try and put so much effort into digitizing and making this technology available? We really wanted to try and emphasize that people at NASA at that time were trying to accomplish an enormous engineering challenge. When we think about NASA and we think about the Apollo program, we tend to gravitate towards the astronauts. The astronauts are to be admired, you know, they risk their lives, they achieved enormous accomplishments for, not just the United States, but for mankind, but when we talk with students one of things that people often forget is for someone to make it to the moon and back safely, you had to have a team to people working collaboratively together to solve some of the most challenging engineering tasks that you could ever imagine, so we kind of used this expression, \"The Heroes Behind the Heroes\" these are the people that sacrificed everything to try and make sure that NASA was going to accomplish this.   [Music]  Host: In 1962, just a couple of dozen miles up the road from where I'm sitting today, President John Kennedy predicted that exploring space would be hard and he set an ambitious goal for the nation.  President John Kennedy: Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of the our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend win too.  Host: John Hansen and his students and a group of irregulars gathered for the task, made it possible for you and me to travel in time fifty years into the past to hear the men and women of that America live up to the challenge. You could listen to all unfold for yourself today at: ExploreApollo.org.  [Music]  Thanks for sticking around to see if there was anything more after the music ended, I mean, what more Could there be to say after four full episodes, right? Well, just this, we decided to take a different approach with these few podcasts for a couple of reasons, one is because we felt the story was worth it, but mostly, it's because we can, the podcast format allows us to spend as much or as little time as we choose on topics that interests us and that we think will interest you, and we have the freedom to try out different styles of storytelling to achieve our goal, capturing your attention with the stories of what's going on past, present and future, in American's space program, and we hope you'll keep coming back for more. The Heroes Behind the Heroes episodes of Houston, We Have a Podcast, were produce by Greg Wiseman and me with editing and audio engineering by Greg, with help from Alex Perryman thanks to the guests who shared their parts of this story, Tatiana Korelsky at the National Science Foundation. Larry Vrooman and John French who helped bring SoundScriber back from the dead. Karen Walseman of the Export Control Office at the Johnson Space Center.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 163, “Next Gen STEM.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. This one is for the students and teachers out there that want to get involved with NASA, even getting some experience with NASA before you hit college. NASA has some exciting ways to get involved in America's space agency and get real hands on experience. An, initiative called Next Gen STEM is doing just that. And, there are some incredible challenges to get involved with, where students can contribute to NASA missions directly. On this episode we're bringing in Jamie Semple and Mike McGlone education specialist and coordinator, respectively, based here at the Johnson Space Center to talk about some of the more recent challenges and how you can stay tuned for some upcoming opportunities. Let's get right into it. Of course, after our opening music. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Jamie and Mike thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Jamie Semple: Thanks, Gary. It's great to be here.  Mike McGlone: Thanks, Gary. Very glad to be back on again after a couple years ago we did a fun one, looking forward to doing it again.  Host: Yeah. Mike, it's been a while, that’s right. We did Microgravity University, MgUE was the last thing we talked about. This one's a little bit different. It's called Next Gen STEM. There's a lot of really cool challenges coming up in the very near future and some that have already taken place. And, we're going to recall some of the ones that have been, I guess, just recently passed. So, this is very exciting. Some of the opportunities that can be for students. I want to get a little bit of a better understanding of who we're talking to here. Just some of your background so we know who are the people that are actually leading some of these activities that get students to participate in actual real-life NASA missions. Jamie we'll start with you.  Jamie Semple: Sure. So, I actually started my career doing research. I was actually part of the team that did the nutrition science research out of the University of Alabama Birmingham. I originally graduated from Stanford University with a biology degree. And, while I was working in the laboratory. I really was interested in actually moving on to teach and actually coached, coached basketball specifically. So, I went ahead and actually completed my masters in secondary education. And, then from there went on to teach high school and middle school science as well as coached football and basketball. So, I really enjoyed that. And, in 2006, I had the opportunity to come to Houston to join the Space Center Houston Education Team at the Official Visitor's Center for Johnson Space Center. And, I was there for about six years. Really enjoyed working with the team there and the programs. And then I had the opportunity to come to Johnson Space Center and specifically the Office of STEM Engagement, which at that time was actually the Office of Education. So, was there for about six years as well. And, really enjoyed just being part of the NASA family and being able to serve and you know, to provide education programs to people around the nation. I did go ahead and explore some different opportunities in 2017, but I made my way back to Johnson Space Center at the end of 2018. And, I've been working on the NASA App Development Challenge ever since. So, looking forward to sharing some information about that today.  Host: Well, very good. And, so nice to have you back. I'm zooming in here on the part of your career where you were going for a science degree and then somewhere in there you got passionate about teaching others. Was it, was it a moment, some event that you went out and you were teaching, and something just clicked where you're like, “oh wow, this is awesome, I can actually influence other people's careers? This is what I want to do.” Was there some moment that, that made you want to change your career path?  Jamie Semple: I wouldn't say a specific moment. I was always a big fan of NASA and was really interested in what was going on with the agency. I actually grew up west of Houston, Katy, Texas. And, I remember coming to Johnson Space Center as a little kid. So, I always enjoyed the, you know, seeing what's going on and very interested in the space program. I also like working on teams where I can help others be successful. So just as I was thinking about those things and enjoying coaching basketball. And, just wanted to try to, you know, bring all those things together. So, been very lucky, like I said, I was lucky to be able to come over in 2006 and actually join the Space Center Houston team and actually come onboard with Johnson Space Center and the Office of Education. So, it's been, you know, close to I would say 12 years now in space science education. But I really have enjoyed the opportunities to be able to just serve the community and obviously teach as many as people as possible.  Host: Very good. I'm very excited to get into some of those things that we're doing here at NASA. But first, let's go back over to Mike. Mike, a little bit about yourself.  Mike McGlone: Sure, you bet. My background is in STEM education and training. I've been a classroom teacher, teaching mostly high school sciences. I also worked in the nonprofit career for a while doing informal education and training of volunteers. I came to NASA first in 2004, working with a group at the time, Aerospace Education Services Project, which did teacher development programs, teacher education throughout the United States, also did student programs, etcetera. Had to leave for a while. There was the shuttle program, some cutbacks. So, I spent some time then doing online education and developing science curriculum and activities. Then we had everybody come back few years ago and now to the Office of Education now Office of STEM Engagement. And, I've been working on these new student challenges, which is our purpose for today, you know, about getting kids excited about NASA and getting them actually involved in the missions.   Host: Well, let's go right into that Mike. Both of you mentioned starting in the Office of Education. Now it's called NASA Stem Engagement. So, Mike tell me a little bit more about this. What is, what is STEM engagement?  Mike McGlone: You bet. I guess it started about two years ago, but about 18 months ago it became official, we moved to the Office of STEM Engagement. And, what it was, more than just a name change. We really wanted to focus on engaging students. And NASA's mission, I mean, that's actually, kind of our tagline to inspire, engage, educate, and employ. Go out and talk to folks about the STEM pipeline. You know, kids, students out there that are working towards STEM careers, which of course NASA employs hundreds of those and through our contractors, thousands of those. And, we need to keep people moving along that pipeline to get involved. So, what we want to do is focus on those activities that actually engage the students in our mission. From the simplest things of, you know, watching an eclipse or watching a launch and doing some things to, in fact an activity we're going to talk about today where students are actually doing some basic research and designing of materials and software that may actually be used in future missions.  Host: Oh see, that's very significant. It's not just like a random exercise, this is actual, practical research and experience. Someone can lock on to it and then find that there's actual use to some of this. And, if they find it fun and interesting, perhaps dedicate their careers to it. As per that last thing you mentioned, Mike, that was the purpose and the goals of STEM engagement, that last one, being employed, getting more people to go into STEM fields.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Most definitely, just touched on that. You know, it is one of those things we keep hearing about from Congress, national leaders is we need more folks involved in the STEM fields not only at NASA but across the country. Of course, we're interested in the NASA folks, but yeah, it's definitely something very important to the country.  Host: And, you're talking about a whole range of programs. How do we do this? How do we engage students and get them to this point where they're actually considering or at the very least participating in STEM activities, being science, technology, engineering, math? What's the whole, if you were to take a whole snapshot of STEM engagement and all the activities that's being done within that office, what kinds of things could you expect to do?  Mike McGlone: Oh wow. It's a long, long list, which we don't have time to cover it all today. But I can give you a brief overview. And, I think Jamie will jump in with a few of the, some specifics. But we have programs that are designed everywhere in both the formal and the informal education world. You know, we focus at students that are K through 16, so it's not just your elementary, middle, and high school students. We have, there are programs out there for college students, even graduate level, even some post doctorate things. It includes internships for those students. And, it could be as simple as activities that teachers can use in the classrooms about Artemis, like the SLS or the Orion, to very simple things such as, during a launch, we put together education kits that teach students about like, the recent Commercial Crew launch that we had back in the end of May, first of June. Some of the more in-depth things are such as, the challenges and that Jamie and I are going to talk about just a little bit more here today.  Host: Yeah. Let's go right into that then. Jamie, so the topic of today's discussion is Next Gen STEM. That's one of the many, I guess, activities that fall under the umbrella of STEM Engagement. Tell me a little bit more about this. What's Next Gen STEM?  Jamie Semple: So, Next Gen STEM is actually a project composed of a variety of different items. And, Mike touched on a little bit of those. But, pretty much is an integrated portfolio of everything from activities to educational products, grants, partnerships, and then student engagement opportunities. Primarily focused on the idea that we want to be able to provide an opportunity for K through 12 students to directly contribute to our NASA's project and mission goals. So, that development challenge and the word challenge are actually under that project umbrella. And, within Next Gen STEM, there's quite a few different things. And, Mike talked a little bit about those. But they're really focused in the four key areas, our mission driven focus areas. There is Commercial Crew, Aeronautics, Moon to Mars, and STEM on Station. And Mike and I actually work on the Moon to Mars team. And, within that specific project, there are actually five student challenges. There are educator guides. There are a lot of different resources available in regards to current projects that are going on. Like, Mike talked a little bit about resource kits for upcoming missions. There's actually a Mars 2020 toolkit that is available online. So, there is a wide array, excuse me, there's a wide range of different activities and opportunities for people to get involved with. So, if you look at some of the other focus areas, there's virtual reality fieldtrips, there's a citizen's science guide, and there's videos. There's actually opportunities for professional development through the Educator Professional Development Collaborative. So, there's a lot of different things. But the main goal here is to get, get people excited and spark their interest in STEM. Really focus on showing them that there are ways to be involved in STEM Careers. And, then just giving them that opportunity to contribute to what NASA is doing. So, that's exactly what that development challenge and the WEAR challenge fall in place.  Host: There's so many elements to this, Jamie. It can be a little bit overwhelming just diving into the list that you were going through. I'm trying to think about myself. If I was a, if I was a teacher, if I was a student and I had general interest in participating in some of these. I know a lot of people engage with the Commercial Crew Program, with the Demo-2 mission, Bob, and Doug launching to the station and returning home to Earth. A lot of people engaged in that. But, now there's actually a chance to participate in some of that program. And, you guys are part of the Moon to Mars, so some exploration initiatives. Very, very exciting stuff. But, if I were to look at that, I'd be kind of overwhelmed right off the bat. Oh man, there's so much. There's all these different resources that I can go. Where do I start? Jamie, if you were to, if you were to say this to either, either a teacher or student or someone that was eligible or I guess interested in investigating some of this, where would you tell them to start? To at least get their toes in the water here.  Jamie Semple: Yeah, great question. So, kind of depends on which group you're in. But definitely go to the Next Gen STEM website. And, that will give you an opportunity to obviously see what, they can click on the different mission focus areas and see all the resources that are available. Like you said, there's just a lot of great products out there, great activities and things that people can participate in as well. So, another way to get involved and actually get updates on what's going on, more current updates, is the NASA Express. And, you can actually sign up for that email. And, you'll get updates on what's going on as far as projects, challenges, live events, kind of like what you were talking about with Demo-2 and of course the upcoming Crew-1 mission here in a few months. So, you definitely want to sign up for that, especially if you want to get those, you now, specific up to date opportunities via email and see those as they're coming out. And, then also NASA social media. I know that both Mike and I, for our student challenges, we actually utilize that to get information out about information sessions or in the case of our challenge start date or our kickoff events. So, we definitely utilize that as well. So, there's just a, like you said, there's a lot out there and there's a couple different ways that you can actually find out what's going on in regards to the office of STEM Engagement, in this case Next Gen STEM.  Host: Now Mike, I'm listening to some of these resources that Jamie's pointing out. And, I think what's nice about this is we're in this interesting time where COVID-19 has a lot of us working from home. I know NASA, us specifically at the Johnson Space Center, many of us are at a work from home status. But, seems like a lot of these different resources that you can access are online and available, either if you're going into the office, performing jobs there or school. Or if you're like us and you're stuck at home. There's a lot of these, there's ways to access this information even during COVID-19.  Mike McGlone: Oh, most definitely. If you go to the webpage that Jamie mentioned, at NASA.gov/STEM, it'll take you to our page within NASA that breaks down all the activities. And like you were talking about, what do we have for students? What do we have that will be of interest to educators? And, even for students it breaks it down to their age range. And, a new product that we actually did, as COVID-19 actually, you know, took off back in April, we went through a lot of our activities and pulled them together in a product we call NASA at Home. And, these were activities that, as a group of our educators went through to actually review and said, “hey these are things the kids actually could do at home. They fit in their curriculum. Where does it fit?” Either to help supplement what the teachers are having them do for classes or just something to do for the fun of it. So, and that's all pulled together like you were saying it is a plethora. Trying to keep up with it will drive you a little bit crazy. But there is plenty of stuff there to look at. And, it's broken down, like I said, in a really nice way. You can look at it, you know, by grade. Are you a student? What are you looking for? You know, do you want to be a NASA intern? Do you want to be, are you in kindergarten and looking for something to do or looking at it with your parents? It's just a great site to go and find what you're looking for.  Host: This is perfect. And, I know this can be overwhelming. So, I'm lucky to have both of you on today because you are leading specific challenges that we can dive into now. So, going beyond this cloud of information, all of these different resources that you can access, let's dive into -- these, some of the specific things that can be done through this program through Next Gen STEM. Jamie, I know you're the lead for the App Development Challenge. This one sounds interesting. I know you had some experience with the App Development Challenge before. Tell me a little bit about this.  Jamie Semple: Yes. Very excited to launch year-two of App Development Challenge. All the information that we've talked about today is actually available on our ADC website. And, that's NASA.gov/education/appchallenge. But this is year-two. Our pilot program year, last year, we actually collaborated with the Ascent Abort-2 team, or the AA-2 team to actually have students build an app out of visualized flight data for the flight test that took place in July of 2019. So, it was a great pilot program year for us. We had the opportunity to bring a couple teams down to the, to the flight test at Kennedy Space Center. And, we're actually building off the success of that pilot program year to launch the new challenge, which is actually open for registration right now. And, in just a few days we will actually have our live virtual kickoff event on September 30th. So, this year's challenge, we are collaborating with the NASA Space Communications and Navigation Team. Their acronym is SCaN, so we'll refer to them as NASA SCaN. So, we are partnering with SCaN to have student teams create an app that will visualize the South Pole region of the Moon. So, as everyone talks about the Artemis program and us returning to the Moon, this is a direct tie into exactly where future exploration will be. So, we're very excited that we can offer this to the middle school and high school students throughout the nation. So, we're looking forward to getting the challenge up and running on September 30th.  Host: You know, if I'm a middle school and high school student, I'm trying to remember myself back in the day. And, I'm hearing this, right. I'm hearing, “hey you have an opportunity to come up with this great way to map the polar region and to do all these fancy space things.” I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is I'm immediately, Jamie, I'm immediately overwhelmed. I'm like there's no way that I have the skill set to do this. I mean this sounds pretty cool. But, how can I contribute to something like this? I don't have any experience. I might not be the right person to do this. Tell me about the, you know, the whole challenge and the ways to make it accessible to those that might be interested and take this opportunity to learn how to do it, for those that may want to participate but, at this point, are kind of scared to.  Jamie Semple: That’s a great question and comments regarding the challenge, we have worked very hard to make it more accessible to the students. This is a highly rigorous challenge, you know, seven weeks, it's a very short time frame that you have to create an app. So, teams that are registered to actually build the app, actually have to have a minimum of five students. They also have to have a lead teacher. And, there's more information on the website regarding eligibility and actually, how to register a team to participate. We do, we'll provide a lot of resources along the way to help teams be successful. On September 30th when we have our live kickoff event, we will actually have on our website, the ADC guide. And, that guide will give you all the specifics and details on how to participate in the challenge. And, exactly what we hope to see with your team’s lunar South Pole app. So, in addition to that, we will also provide a lunar data file. That’s the actual data, it’s the position and slope data from the area that we want you to visualize. So, you will actually have both of those components. And, then during our live kickoff event, we'll talk about how to get started in developing your app. So, if you have an interest in coding, computer science, obviously you're going to have to work with some other folks. But, a minimum of five students makes up a team. There is no maximum team size. So, you can have as many folks as you’d like to participate in the first phase of developing your app. And, then along the way, we're also going to provide live virtual connections, where we actually have subject matter experts from NASA, talk through how to develop an app. So, we'll be supporting teams that way throughout the entire challenge.  Host: See, that's a great way to kickoff. If you have a basic interest in space and you have a basic interest in coding and software, which I know is a very big field and with a lot of opportunities. This sounds like an amazing opportunity. I wanted to zoom in, though, on this Ascent Abort-2 App Development Challenge that you had. This is something you already did. You have a, you have a case where you tried something new and you saw it through to the end with results. Can you tell me more about that challenge? How the students engaged with the Ascent Abort-2 and some of the things you saw at the end of this whole process?  Jamie Semple: Sure. Yeah. So that was our pilot program year. So, we were trying to obviously figure out how to navigate a new challenge and provide it to students at the same time. So, it was very interesting. But we do have a technical advisor from the Ascent Abort-2 team. We have to do this same thing with this year's challenge. We actually have a technical advisor from the SCaN team. And, last year, with the Ascent Abort-2 challenge, we were able to provide resources and best practices along, I think it was a seven-week time frame for teams to develop the app. So, we had a great response, a lot more teams involved in the challenge than we thought. And, honestly, we received some great videos of the team’s apps and then honestly, we were just thoroughly impressed with the work that they did. Making this a team-based challenge is something that very closely mimics what NASA teams do throughout their work as they seek to collaborate, to successfully complete a project. So, having that same dynamic will help them understand the challenges and how you overcome those as you're actually, in this case, building an app. But, it's tremendously successful. We did take two teams to the flight test in July of 2019. And, they were actually able to see the flight test live, see the launch. They got access to the mission control room where they got a chance to talk to some folks that were working on the mission. And then, we were actually able to use some of the data from the flight test, some altered data from the flight test and actually run it on the students' apps. And, it was great to see because the flight test ended up actually exceeding, I think the height for the test, the launch itself for the elevation of that, that AA-2 actually went to. So, we were actually able to see that on the students' apps. So, it was really cool. They did an excellent job. And, like I said, we've used that model and expanded on it a little bit to offer this year's challenge.  Host: What a cool thing. Not only do you get to actually participate in some of this stuff. But I bet you that you had a bunch of eyes lighting up just walking around mission control and actually seeing the Ascent Abort-2 mission, seeing a rocket go off the pad. That must have been such an incredible experience. There was something, I know, I have here called the Culminating Event. Was that, was that it when they actually went to go see it or am I thinking about something else here?  Jamie Semple: No. You got it. That's exactly it. The Culminating Event was five days. And, the students went on VIP tours. They got to present to NASA leaderships. And, we really just had a great time getting them immersed in the NASA culture. They also had the opportunity to present to the general public. So, after the flight test, there's a time for community engagement and outreach. And, they were able to talk to people of all ages and share some of their experiences. This year we're looking to do the same thing. Like I said, the challenge starts on September 30th, it'll actually wrap up on November 18th, with student team video submissions. So, the teams actually don't submit their apps. They actually show a similar video and they post it to YouTube for our teams to review. And, we just obviously, are looking at the video and going through the app requirements. And, then based off of review of those videos, we'll down select interviews. That's where a smaller group of selected teams, we'll actually interview with the SCaN and ADC teams. So, that's a chance to actually talk to the people working for SCaN and learn a little bit more about the team and the app that they've created. After that, we will down select again. We might take one, we might take two or more teams. But those will be our top teams for our Culminating Event. Right now, we're looking at February 2021 for our Culminating Event, that hopefully, will be at a NASA Field Center. But, if not, if we have to do some sort of virtual student symposium, we will definitely do that. But we definitely want to highlight obviously, the students and their work, and that Culminating Event does that.  Host: Now this, yeah, we're still, some uncertainty here with COVID-19. But I'm sure, you know, if we have the COVID, if we have the Culminating, or sorry, the kickoff event, my apologies, coming up here in just a few days, September 30th. I'm assuming, you know, you're going to have students from, is it all over the United States? And, then would they be paired in teams across the United States, so all this work will be done virtually, I guess, for the Fall period of 2020?  Jamie Semple: Yeah. So, teams can be from the same school, different schools. We really have opened it up to formal and informal U.S. educational organizations. So, that really means across the nation, but could potentially mean internationally, if it's like a military base overseas, a school that wants to participate. Science centers can participate. So, you can actually form a team with students from different schools. And, the team is registered by a lead teacher. It has to be a certified and practicing K through 12 educator. But, once the teams are formed, then they can go ahead and obviously start working on developing their app. It's going to be interesting to see how they do that. This challenge is very well set up to be a virtual challenge. They can post their apps online, obviously, and share those from different resources. Most of the software that they're going to use will be online. We don't require them to have a specific operating system or use specific coding language. They determine all that. So, they can find out who has strengths in different areas, and they'd formulate their team that way. So, it's really an open ended and, in regards to what we require. But the main focus here is it's all a student led challenge. And, as students begin to navigate how to build that app, we'll provide those resources and suggestions and different presentations during those live virtual connections. So, we're looking forward to see, you know, obviously how this second year of the challenge goes. We're very excited it ties directly into Artemis. And, more specifically, these students are going to contribute to future mission planning. So that, these apps could actually help the SCaN team train new staff members on, you know, what's the best route for exploration on the Moon. But the main thing is when our astronauts get to the South Pole of the Moon, they need to be safe, they need to be able to communicate with Earth. And, this app brings all those things into play. They will visualize the Moon South Pole region. But they also have to do two additional things. They actually have to plot a path for explorations. So, the astronauts are not always going to land in the place that they're going to explore. So, there's a landing site and we have a destination site. And, they have to plot that path for exploration. And, then the last thing they have to do is they have, actually have to identify ten communication link checkpoints, so places that we can maintain that communication with Earth. So, a very exciting challenge. We're looking forward to getting things rolling on September 30th.  Host: Maps, adventures, communication, what a cool way to participate in returning humans to the Moon. Very, very cool. We'll make sure to put this information about the kickoff event at the very top. For those who are listening and thinking “oh man this is really cool,” we'll have some links and some information in our show notes here where you can go and explore these. So that's just one example of the many things going on in STEM Engagement. This is the App Development Challenge. Mike, I know you're the lead for something called NASA WEAR, the NASA WEAR Challenge. Can you, can you talk a little bit more about that?  Mike McGlone: Yeah. I'd love to. NASA WEAR and believe it or not, that's not an acronym, even though the word NASA is, this one is not an acronym.  Host: Gasp. [Laughter]  Mike McGlone: But we have a challenge very similar in set up to the App Development Challenge that Jamie just talked about. But we have a totally different focus in what we're working on. When our astronauts go into deep space, and we define deep space as anything, really beyond low-Earth orbit, which is where the International Space Station is at. As you go beyond, as you go beyond that low-Earth orbit, you leave Earth's atmosphere, you get beyond or into the much weaker parts of Earth's, magnetosphere. So, we don't get protection from radiation, especially the radiation that's coming from our, from the sun, what we call solar particle events. It's constantly coming, but there's also these larger, makes the explosions, radiation from the sun. You know, you hear about solar flares or coronal mass ejections. That's what one of the outcomes of that is, a lot more radiation from space. And, the human body is very much susceptible to that. And, it's, and it's not good. So that's one of the key hazards that astronauts face going on deep missions back to the Moon or on to Mars. And, in spacecraft design, you know, they did their best to harden the spacecraft to protect the astronauts. But, these larger events, they need more protection. So, we partnered with a group here at Johnson Space Center, the RadWorks Team, who also has team members at Glenn Research Center, in Cleveland, Ohio and Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia, that look at wearable technology that the astronauts could dawn during these large events to provide more protection. Then that's where we got the name NASA WEAR. So, what we were asking students to do, and again, we're focused on middle and high school teams. So basically, grades 5 through 12, is asking them to design garments and or headgear that the astronauts could put on inside their spacecraft, to give them added protection. And, of course to do that, they have to understand what kind of materials are good for protecting against radiation. You know, while it might be nice to have a lead suit, you really can't put that on a spacecraft. It weighs too much. So, what are some lightweight materials that protect you well. They have to, you know, learn about some material science, you have to learn about radiation. And, then they have to get into design process to what would be the best design to protect the human body? And, we're looking at the upper torso, basically the blood forming organs in the upper torso and the head, that's where the headgear comes in with the brain and especially the eyes. So, that's what we challenge students to do. We give them several weeks to learn about that. We work with our RadWorks partners that are at Langley that are a group of material scientists and space scientists there, space physicists that we share with the students. You know, what they're working against in terms of the radiation, talk about human factors. You know, you may put this thing on, but you still got to fly that spacecraft, you still got to do all the things that you got to do to remain safe, keep everything operational. So, you got to be able to move. You got to be able to do all those kinds of things, you know, we talk about protecting the eyes. But you still got to have vision to look at the dials, so to find switches, find things in the spacecraft. So, finding the best materials and how to put that together. And, then we allow them to submit their design process. We select those, ask them to build a low fidelity prototype, low fidelity in that we know they're not going to have all the materials available, you know, in that middle school or high school or even find at home that would be the real thing that we'd use on a mission. But they get to use a good facsimile of the material to design what their prototype will look like. And, then we put it in front of that team from RadWorks and other NASA scientists and engineers and we have them actually present their findings. You know, this is what our, this is why we did this design, this is how it works. And the folks at RadWorks have actually taken some of those design ideas and put them into some of the new prototypes that they're working on. So, the students, in our first go around is, we're in our second year now, but our first go around actually, some of the ideas, like I said, the team has used. They did 3D printing, they did, they used water, these, all sorts of things that the team had not thought of or even some things they had thought of but hadn't had time to investigate. They love the ideas that the students came up with. So, that's the gist of what we're working on is wearable technologies.  Host: Yeah. Like, very fancy space fashion, almost, wearing, you know, headgear and I'm thinking like plated armor. But, I'm sure, I'm sure the students came up with some really, really unique ideas there.  Mike McGlone: They really did. The first year we really focused on just the garment. And, we had students that did biomimicry, they used ideas from nature to come up with one. We had one that did a, the name has skipped me, but basically, it's an African aardvark that's got these, like you said, plates, almost look like armor, they mimicked that. We had those that used ancient, I mean like medieval armor ideas, chain mail, but they did printing 3D using polyethylene, you know, plastic that were interchangeable to actually provide that kind of protection that we're looking for. So, they really came up with some great ideas. And, we did it again this year, the activity and this is the year that we added the headgear. And, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do. Because we're still in the middle of wrapping it up for this year. We just earlier, just selected our final teams for our Culminating Event.  Host: Oh wow, that's a big deal. Yeah, you're going to see some really cool ideas hopefully there. That's amazing. Another example of coming up with unique, unique ways of solving these challenges. I love the 3D printed chain mail idea. That's so cool, instead of shipping something up, you just print it one piece at a time and maybe come up with something, something that can help you out. Very, very cool.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. That was actually something that hadn't been discussed. You know, they had limits on what they could, how much weight of course, that they could use. They gave them a 50-pound maximum for the, for what they could send up. But yeah, the 3D printing, that was one of the first things that the RadWorks folks said is, “hey this is, it's fixable.” You know, either you could print new, new scales if you need them or, it's there because we do have 3D printing capabilities in space. So at least we have hopefully when we go on future missions. So yeah there's so many things that go into this. And, the human factors, it's amazing to me. This is, in a way kind of a set crowd sourcing, using the design process, using students as the idea generators. And, it's really the amazing, different ways that they think and all the different ways that they come up with to address a problem. It's really amazing to watch.  Host: Very cool. And, you say this Culminating Event is coming up very soon. And, I'm assuming that's virtual Culminating Event. What are we, what are we looking at doing for some of the winners here?  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Most definitely. Yeah. COVID definitely had an impact on us. We were originally going to do some of what you heard the App Development Challenge did and we were able to do our first year, which was to take our top teams and have them present live at Langley Research Center to the team, the RadWorks team that works there. Unfortunately, this year, circumstances are not allowing that. So, we are going to a virtual, what we're calling a virtual student symposium, where they're still going to get to hear from NASA experts. And those are what I consider the most important part, their opportunity to present their ideas and findings to our panel of NASA experts and get that review and questions asked and really get that feedback from the experts about their designs.  Host: Very, very cool. You know, I think one of the things that really jumps out to me listening to some of these challenges is, well, the first thing that comes to mind is. Man, where were these things when I was in school? And, maybe it was just my own failure of just not looking in the right places. But, there's so many, so many different opportunities for people to participate in real space challenges and maybe get more exposure to science and engineering than they would in the typical classroom. I think one of the best things about the education field, something you guys both get to participate in, is working with students, you've got to find, have some memories of times where these students are going through these challenges and there's just something in their face, there's something in the way they say something that you can tell that this activity or process has changed them in a way that maybe they weren't considering a STEM field before, but they sure as heck are now. Jamie, I'm sure you have something that comes to mind that, just a memory of a student or maybe just an event where you saw a measurable change in someone's behavior and possibly their career path.  Jamie Semple: Yes certainly, yeah. For the Ascent Abort-2 App Challenge, we had the opportunity to actually set up before the flight test launch at one of the viewing areas. And, so the student teams actually brought their laptops, set them up. So, as everyone from NASA was coming in, these people that had worked on the projects, you know, for months and years. They're coming in, they're actually getting a chance to see, you know, what’s about to happen with the flight test. And, it was just a great opportunity for us to sit back and watch students realize that these are some of the people or the careers that they want to be a part of as they, as they go throughout, you know, their continuing education and obviously and choosing their career. So just watching the engagement and how impressed the folks were that were actually talking to students and just seeing the students light up in terms of, you know, this is, this is what they're interested in doing. And, these people are doing the exact same thing. So, that was just an awesome opportunity for both the students, and it is for us to see kind of everything come to a fruition when it comes to, you know, how we design these challenges, and the impact that we hope they have.  Host: Very cool. Now Mike, what are some of the things that we can look forward to? I'm sure, you know, we're going to keep this episode up here for a while. And, we have these challenges coming up in the very near future. So, we hope people tune in and get a chance to participate in some of those, in the near term. But Mike, some of those things coming up, coming up in the future that maybe, if they don't, if they miss this opportunity, they'll have some more, sometime down the road.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Thank you for the question about what's coming up next. First off, NASA WEAR, we're getting ready to put together a new iteration of it for the 2020-2021 school year. So, you'll be hearing more about that soon. Keep an eye, Jamie mentioned earlier the NASA Express, which is a weekly newsletter about opportunities. So, look for that specifically. But other things that are coming up, there are lots of them. Like we mentioned earlier, there are lots of different things that are coming out. There's a new opportunity for undergraduates at the university level called SPOCS [Student Payload Opportunity with Citizen Science] that actually put experiments on the International Space Station. There are, there'll be new career opportunities around the upcoming crew launch in October. There are all sorts of things. And, even in the future there are things that are planned. Can't say too much about them yet. But always looking for those opportunities to connect to a mission and bring that excitement to the students. And, as mentioned, the best way to keep up with that is check our NASA STEM website quite often and or sign up for that NASA Express Newsletter, which will give you a weekly update of what's out there.  Host: There you go. Have the opportunities come right, right to you. Perfect. Jamie and Mike, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. What exciting challenges that we have coming up here in the near future. A lot of ways that people can engage in STEM activities even from home, depending on where you are. All these opportunities are available to people and there's a lot more coming up. We've listed a ton of resources here. So, if you didn't catch them all or you don't have a pen and paper next to you to write them all down, don't worry, we'll have all these links and notes in our, in our episode show notes. So, that's for our listeners. Jamie and Mike, thanks again for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Jamie Semple: Thank you so much, Gary.  Mike McGlone: Thanks, Gary.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really hope you enjoyed this conversation with Jamie and Mike. For the students and teachers, I hope you listened to the whole thing. There were a lot of things that we talked about today. I'm just going to make this easy on everyone. And, just go to our episode, our podcast webpage. It's NASA.gov/johnson/hwhap, as in Houston We Have a Podcast, and you can find this Episode, 163. And, we're going to list all the links that we mentioned today here for you.

            "description": "Host: (Gary Jordan): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 313, “Laser Communications.” I'm Gary Jordan, I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight and more. Deep space has recently seen a lot of traffic. Just in the past year, we've had experts on this podcast to discuss Orion, OSIRIS-Rex, Lucy, and Psyche, all spacecrafts that send data back to Earth from the Deep Space Network. This reliable network has served NASA and other countries deep space missions for decades, and with access to space increasing and more space traffic with modern technologies, this means demand for more data. Now the Deep Space Network’s data rates are limited by the method of transmission radio waves. So how can we improve the data rates of deep space communications and near space communications lasers?   We chatted recently on the podcast with Steve Horowitz about an optical laser communications demonstration planned to be on Orion for Artemis II. This is the deep space vehicle humans will take to and from the Moon. This demonstration is one of several to better understand the needs for an improved network. Laser communications over radio can pack a lot more data in a single transmission. But to make it as robust as possible for any user, you have to have a solid infrastructure on the ground, transmitters and receivers to be able to support the demands of future deep space and near space missions. But what are those demands? That's what Dr. Jason Mitchell, director of Advanced Communications and Navigation for NASA's SCaN program or Space Communications and Navigation, is looking to find out. Jason describes the process for better understanding what future deep space missions will need, and how to best support this future. With that, let's find out more about laser communications with Jason Mitchell. Enjoy.  [Music] Host: Jason Mitchell, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. Jason Mitchell: Thank you very much for the invitation. I'm excited to be here.   Host: Yeah, we got a taste of optical communications, laser communications with Steve Horowitz; got to talk with him a couple of episodes back on O2O. It really gave us a taste, but I think there's a lot more to this story here. I want to start with you though, Jason, and understanding your background. What got you to where you are? We're going to be talking about the space communications and navigation and then work our way from just this general overview over to optical communications. But what brought you into this world? What sold you on maybe the idea of space or communications, anything like that? Where did it all begin for you, Jason? Jason Mitchell:  Well, I think maybe resonates a lot with your audiences, Star Wars is what brought me in as a kid to interest of space, right?  Just seeing that on the screen and thinking about it, that got me motivated. Tried to do well in school. Was moderately successful at that goal. Went to college. My PhD, my graduate research was largely focused on celestial mechanics. So I was interested in how things move in space, and numerical methods to try and predict how those things move around in space. Ultimately, my specific dissertation was related to spacecraft attitude dynamics and control, being able to predict spacecraft attitude, which turns out to be kind of important if you want to do things like laser communication pointing is important.  Then I did a Postdoc with the Air Force working on formation flying technologies. So how to get individual spacecraft that might be clustered together to do different interesting kinds of things. That ended up with me migrating to Goddard Space Flight Center where I had a lot of fun working on things like high-altitude GPS for the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, which instantly still has, I think the Guinness Book World Record for highest GPS signal altitude received and used in space. So that was super fun.  I got involved in another sort of experiment called X-Ray Pulsar Navigation. So you may be familiar with that. There was a DARPA program a while back  to look at using pulsars for independent navigation, for a GPS like navigation, that could be used anywhere in the solar system, right? Cause pulsars are visible from everywhere. Whereas GPS satellites are just visible if you're around the Earth. So then we did that, demonstrated that with the NICER mission. The NICER mission was the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer mission that was an ISS payload. So we did that x-ray navigation demonstration and then I sort of migrated to doing other technology elements in a broader scale at Goddard and then eventually moved to SCaN to do technology development for SCaN.   Host: Okay. Yeah. It seems like it got progressively more related to communications navigation, it was a methodical step-by-step part of your career. [Laughs] Jason Mitchell: It may seem like that in retrospect.   Host: Yeah.  Jason Mitchell: But it was not entirely a random walk, but you know, something like that.  Host: Yeah. You know what I found interesting, Jason, is you talked about you didn't do particularly well in school, but what you just mentioned there, each part of your background, of your career, was working on some very complicated stuff. I wonder did you push yourself a little harder to be able to understand some of these complicated things? Maybe driven by your fascination with Star Wars and wanting to enter into a world of space and just pushing yourself. But I mean, you're talking about some complicated stuff. So how'd you navigate that?   Jason Mitchell: No pun intended, right?  [Laugh]  Host: You see what I did there. Jason Mitchell:  Yeah, there you go. It's a good lead in. It was always a challenge for me on the academic side to just sort of get up to speed. So you're absolutely right. It was really mostly about hard work, right? Putting in the hard work to get that deeper understanding. Fortunately, that focus actually just kind of snowballed. And so it was a, you know, sort of a positive reinforcing habit that once I learned what I needed to do, right? Because sometimes it's about really understanding how you need to learn, was just being able to apply that in the new situations, and then focus really on getting down to the heart of what are the basics. Because most times, the basics are exactly that. They're just basics. The rest of it is sort of the dressing that you need to accomplish that basic thing. And that's where the complexities really get built up. But those are things that are, you know, just like building a Lego, right? You just got a bunch of simple blocks. You just have to put them together in the right shape that you want. And that's the real complexity, not necessarily the basic fundamental things. Maybe you think about the basic math or fundamental physics of it. Host: You describe it  so seeming seemingly simple, but I believe the way that you got there was exactly as you said, through the hard work. It was the dedication that got you to a point where you finally were able to understand it, grasp it, and you had to push yourself probably along the way to do a lot of these complicated things. I mean, you talked about working with pulsars. That’s an interesting solution to solving navigation problems. How do you find your way through the sky and just finding unique solutions and diving deep into a subject to better understand it? You’ve got to kind of go along with the flow there.   Jason Mitchell: Yeah. And it's fun. I mean, I think that underscores the whole point. But at least for me, it's not everybody's thing, but sort of that increased lifelong learning is sort of one of the things that drives me. I'm very much interested in doing unique things and in particular, things that enable us as humans to do and learn more, right? I mean, I didn't fall into the science side for the most part. That was not something that resonated with me. But doing the kinds of things that I was interested in helped me enable other things. And so being able to play that role was very satisfying for me.   Host: Very good. Your path took you, like we said interesting ways, but where we were talking about leading was your current role in advanced communication and navigation. And this is within the space communication and navigation. So let's just help our listeners navigate that and understand what this program is, what your role within that program is. Let's start with SCaN, Space Communication and Navigation. You touched on a little bit of this in some of the work that you've done, but as an organization, can you talk about what SCaN does?   Jason Mitchell: Sure. So SCaN, Space Communication and Navigation program at NASA, it's located at Headquarters. We’re organizing the mission directorates, it’s within the Space Operations Mission Directorate. The SCaN program is responsible for making sure that NASA missions can meet their objectives. So, whether that objective is exploring a new place, either robotically or with humans, we are tasked to make sure that the data that they need, they want to get back, comes back in the way that they want, right? That they can actually decode and make use of to make those discoveries. And also to provide the ability to make sure they know where they're going, where they're at, so they can determine how they're going to get there, right? So maybe you think about this as sort of like the navigation guidance control part, right? You have to be able to navigate, find out where you're at, so that you can determine where you want to go to, and then guide to that point. So this office, or this program, is responsible for making sure that missions as they go through their design, their concept formulation, all the way through design development, ultimately to launch an execution that they're able to get all the information they need from the program to be able to accomplish their mission goals.   Host: I see. Okay. So let's take Psyche for example. That's a recent launch that we just had. It's a mission that says, “Okay, I'm a spacecraft Psyche. I want to go to this asteroid called Psyche, so I need to know how to get there, and I want to send some very valuable data from deep into space back to Earth.” And that's where you guys come in and you say, “Okay, here's the navigation story, and here's the communication story.” Am I characterizing that correctly?   Jason Mitchell: Yeah, I mean, that's the high-level overview, right? Because I think one of the things that sometimes may be glossed over or is sometimes oversimplified is that by and large, particularly for deep space missions, where you don't have an autonomous navigation capability like GPS available to you, your communication and navigation capability are tied to your communication link, because that's actually what you're using to get the basic observations that you're going to use to determine what your trajectory is, and then ultimately where you're at, right? Do your orbit determination or your position determination.   Host: Okay. Yeah. All these different missions have different goals and different objectives, but they all are within the infrastructure that you guys build, maintain, and manage, and get feedback on. Everybody wants data. Everybody wants to get to where they're going. So you are sort of the, the roadmap for them. You're the GPS. If I want to get to somewhere locally, I'm going to pull up my phone and go to Google Maps, and I can trust that there's an infrastructure in place, right? I'm going to trust that there's GPS that's going to know where I am and know where I need to go and tell me the path to get there. It's that version, but for space.   Jason Mitchell:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean really, if you maybe think about it in a more general term, we would maybe talk about it as an enterprise architecture to be able to execute missions, right? It's the fundamental infrastructure that you have to have, one of the fundamental infrastructure pieces that you have to have, to be able to execute missions.   Host: And there's a lot that we rely on. Even today, we're going to talk about the Deep Space Network. I know there's the Near Space Network. There's different components that are used every day for space missions that are up in orbit, and of course, deep into space as well. Now, your role in advanced communications, where does that distinction lie within that program?    Jason Mitchell:  So the program has division elements. We have network operations. They're responsible for the network elements and assets that actually operate to deliver these services to missions. We have a development group that supports sort of targeted updates and capability additions to that operations network. And then we have a division, which is my division, which is Advanced Communication and Navigation Technology division. And my job is to look across the mission portfolio for future needs. So I work with our systems engineers, who work with the missions, they're sort of coming through the formulation pipeline and we look at what kinds of needs they have, and then we sort of evaluate what technologies are available, what the requirements might be, and then we sort of try to put our finger on how we would go from what we have now to what we would need to meet a particular requirement. And we would sort of call that maybe a gap, right? There would be a technology gap that we would have to identify an investment plan so that we could either develop or take an existing technology and mature it enough so that we could close that gap and then make that capability available.   Host:  Well, this is going to lead very nicely into our discussion about optical cause I know that's probably one of the things you're working on most. So optical we're going to lead to, right? This is one of those advanced things. This is one of those capabilities that a lot of different spacecraft and a lot of researchers are looking at because of its capabilities. But let's talk about the infrastructure now. So we have satellites. We have these capabilities, ground lines, all communication systems in place right now, communicating with spacecraft and deep space and low-Earth orbit. All different areas within space. Now when we try to characterize that Deep Space Network, Near Space Network, how do you typically try to characterize the network that you currently have?   Jason Mitchell:  It's a challenge. So we draw. So we sort of have this imaginary distance choice that we talk about things that are, you know, two million miles away and less as sort of Earth vicinity. And then we'll treat that boundary as everything outside of that is, we would call that deep space. So that gives us a little bit of wiggle room with the Moon, right? So there's some overlap there, because you could potentially have non-DSN assets, right? Other Earth-based assets, antennas, supporting the Moon. In fact, certainly other space agencies, and commercial entities actually are onboard to support sort of the overall Artemis view about how we'll execute the remainder of Artemis and beyond Artemis.   But we typically focus on the near-Earth network as being those assets that support sort of LEO. And one of the things that our program also does, in addition to the Deep Space Network, we also operate the TDRS satellite constellation, right? The Tracking and Data Relay system, which is the geosynchronous orbiting number of satellites to give you 360-degree, 24/7 coverage in the radio frequency spectrum so you can get data from anywhere you want below the constellation. So for example, ISS is a huge user of that. During the Shuttle days, Shuttle was a huge user of that. I mean, in fact, that was sort of part of the reason for TDRS to support Shuttle, right? And those capabilities as a build out for ISS went. Then for the deep space side, you know, deep space is differentiated from that in that the antennas are much larger usually, right? So the 34 and 70 meter antennas at the different locations, Goldstone, Madrid, and Canberra are the three primary DSN sites. And they receive their data, you know, in whatever band is appropriate for the mission, right? I mean, this is one of the things that we focus on, is that there's no one-stop shop solution for everybody. That's why we work with the missions to make sure that we can meet their need, because they may have some particular quirk that means, well, we would ordinarily do this for this kind of mission, but because you have this unique need, this unique mission need, we would engineer a solution for you like this. And so that's why we have this sort of array—no pun intended—this array of assets available to meet all those kinds of mission needs.   Host: I loved all the puns that we're throwing in here. It's actually kind of fun. Now radio frequency, right? So when you talk about a lot of what we have now, you talk about the different assets that we have in place in order to support all of these different missions. Am I reading this right, in that all of them use radio frequency?   Jason Mitchell: Correct.   Host: Okay. So what are the pros and what are the cons of using RF for space communications?   Jason Mitchell: Well, pros are certainly that it's what we've used up to this point, right? It’s extremely flexible. It’s highly available. It’s well understood. It’s sort of easy to implement. I mean, I think one of the best things is that all of the engineering is all clear, right? There's no limited ambiguity, except when you're trying to push the boundaries of the envelope, right? If you're really trying to push up to high frequencies or if you're trying to do really novel or nifty things. What you need to do for space is all well known. And that's really attractive for space users, right? Because they don't want risk in their communication system. They want risk in what it's going to take for them to execute their particular mission, right? Maybe their risk is the particular instrument design, right? Maybe it's a novel new instrument design. They're not quite sure if it's going to work, right? Or maybe they won't get enough data, or something like that from their particular instrument. They don't want infrastructure items to be the risk for them to take on, right? And so that's sort of the focus there.   Host: I see. What's nice about the radio frequency infrastructure, you talked about one of the pros is just the fact that we've been using it for so long, right? You mentioned TDRS during shuttle, RF goes back even before that. There's these ground stations all over the Earth that support all of these missions. So as an example, to help us to understand, let's just say there's a deep space mission, and it's sending a signal, and it's the ground station in Canberra that receives that signal. But it's the mission control team in JPL that needs to receive that signal. Now it goes from space to the ground station in Canberra. How does it get from Australia over to California?   Jason Mitchell: Yeah. So that's where we leverage all of the existing terrestrial networking capability, right? We bundle that data over the traditional backhaul that we lease from various providers that connect to all the sites. And then that data is routed back to the Deep Space Operations Center, or complex, not just because it has the acronym DSOC doesn't mean that. There's only so many short acronyms, right? So you're bound to have some collisions here, and that that's one of them, that's the collisions. And so at that routing, and again, that's located at JPL, so once that data comes in from wherever, whether it was Canberra or whether it's Madrid or Goldstone, it would be routed there. It would be sort of packaged and then with whatever agreements for traditional terrestrial backhaul, that data would then be delivered to the appropriate operation center. Whether it was a science processing center, or whether it was a mission operation center. That’s how that data would be delivered.   Host: Yeah. So this is sort of setting the tone for how data is received, how data is sent. It goes through these channels. These well-constructed, well thought out channels to get from the spacecraft to the end user and everything in between, managed by SCaN. Now, this leads into your role, right? In advanced communications is understanding what comes next. We've had RF, we've had the Near Space Network, Deep Space Network. We've been using these assets. Let's figure out what comes next. And the conversation that we're leading to, Jason, is lasers, is optical communication. We've had a taste of this on the podcast before. But in the broadest sense, just to help listeners with an overview of what laser communications, what optical communications is, what are we looking at here?   Jason Mitchell: Well so, back to the notion of RF, right? As you proceed through the RF spectrum, as you go up in increasing frequency, we're all sort of very familiar with the sort of what we would call S-band frequencies, right? Cause that's roughly the gigahertz area where we're all connected with Wi-Fi. Like right now many of us are, whether we're aware of or not, we're probably connected some Wi-Fi thing somewhere, exchanging data. So to get more data, you just proceed up the frequency through the spectrum, right? You go to higher and maybe you go from S- to X-band, right? Increase frequency. And if you want even more data, maybe you go from X- to K- or Ka-band or Ku-band, you're increasing in frequency. Now you're up into the tens of gigahertz in terms of frequency. And if you really want to push RF, you can go up into the W- and V-bands and get even more data. But the challenge there is that you start to have difficulty with weather transmitting directly to Earth, right? So you start to have weather effects. And like, well, if you're going to have weather effects, why don't we just sweep all the way up, sweep out of the gigahertz range and sweep into the terahertz range? And that's where we get to where we're at now, which is the near-infrared, sort of 1550 nanometer wavelength. We sort of generally call that as Optical C-band. And that's interesting because that's the target of terrestrial Optical networking, right? I mean, all the back—we’re all data hungry, right? I mean, I'm a voracious data user, so all that data on Earth is already pumped with lasers through fibers, right?  So the benefit there is that we're sort of just lifting the network up, right? We're bringing that into space, making it usable in space, ruggedized for space. But instead of a fiber carrying the medium, we're doing it through free space, right? We're doing it just a free space laser communication. Now, it's much easier to do space-to-space lengths with lasers, because there's no atmosphere to impact the signal, nothing to impact the light that's being transmitted. When you transmit to Earth, the atmosphere can distort the signal.  And of course, just like with the higher frequency RF, if you have rain clouds and things like that, it can obstruct your ability to receive your data, right? It can block your data. So that's where lots of things come into play about how you predict weather, how you assess where locations to receive the optical light should be. Ultimately it's just that we're moving up into, you know, for a non-technical phrase, just a faster wiggle, right? I mean, we're wiggling faster so we can pack more data into the wiggles.   Host: I see, yeah. I'm imagining the squiggly lines, the wiggles as you're describing it. Okay so it sounds great, right? You jam more data into a single transmission. I think there's a lot of researchers, there's a lot of individuals out there that would love this capability for space missions. More data means you don't have to be so choosy. It means that during mission, you can get more real time data versus data that you have to store on board. We've talked a couple of times on this podcast on Artemis I and Orion, there was a lot that Orion was able to transmit through the Deep Space Network for real time data. But there was so much on board that a lot of it just had to be stored and gathered later because it couldn't all transmit through space. So this is definitely a capability that a lot of people would be interested in. Now, you said a couple of cons, though, right? So you said weather, right? So we talked about the ground infrastructure, we talked about the capabilities on the ground for the Deep Space Network, Near Space Network? And of course, in orbit some of the assets there, we talked about TDRS. So what infrastructure do we currently have in place for supporting optical?   Jason Mitchell: So right now, we have no, I wouldn't characterize it—for example, with respect to the existing networks that we support, Deep Space Network and the Near Space Network—I would not characterize the stations that we have now, ground stations we have now as operational, even though they're operating, right? I think you have to be a careful about that term. But for the infrastructure that we have right now, we have two Optical Ground Stations, one at Table Mountain Facility that's operated by our JPL partners. And we have another station, at Haleakalā in Hawaii. So those are sort of well-placed because you point out, as we mentioned, the weather becomes an issue.   [OPTICAL GROUND STATIONS IMAGE] Well, if you're able to get up above the weather, that's actually super. Because then you don't have to worry about it if you're above it. Now Table Mountain's not quite high enough to do that. You still have effects. And it also turns out that Table Mountain is sort of in the flight path for LAX. And so that is another set of in infrastructure elements that we have to have to make sure that we're meeting safety requirements, right? You don't want anyone to inadvertently intersect your beam, although from the perspective of our choice of the 1550 nanometers, that's an eye-safe range, right? That's again, another US industry telecom standard that we try to focus on specifically for those safety reasons. And we're not broadcasting it high enough, transmitting it high enough power for that to be really a problem for aircraft.  So there are infrastructure elements in place. I would characterize them as experimental, because what we're really trying to understand how to do with the sort of the portfolio of risk reduction activities for space users we have, is to understand what it takes to get to operations. I think it's one thing to simply develop a technology, test it and say, “Yep, we met,” you know, if you're familiar with the technology readiness levels, if you think about TRL6 where you say, “Okay, it's ready to go into a mission.” We're, we're not really done there when it comes to infusion, when you're talking about something like infrastructure, we really have to go through all the challenges of learning what does it take to make it operational? Sure, if you think about it as a lab exercise, it might take 10 or 15 people to do the demonstration, get the data that you want, and it might take, six or eight hours to be able to do a short data collection run. You really don't want that, right? Because you want to be able to support multiple missions. You want to be able to turn over really quickly. You don't want to have to burn out operators operating long hours and potentially isolated areas because there's human impacts on that operation. So this is the way we're trying to execute this portfolio is to really understand what it's going to take from these experimental ground stations to enable this as an operational capability. Host: Very important distinction, right? We talked about the infrastructure and what's in place and this is what you're doing exactly, is trying to figure out, okay, what comes next? And of course, you don't want to gut the current infrastructure, which works so well, to replace it with something that you're right, we still need to figure out, we still need to understand what these operations are like. And so you talked about technology demonstrations. We mentioned one, where we talked with Steve Horowitz about O2O and we can certainly investigate that one again. But you have these spacecraft that are loaded with optical communications as a technology demonstration to do, I think exactly what you're sitting out to do is, hey, let's just see how this works. Let's see what we need, what the capabilities are, what the users are requesting in terms of data transmission.  And we have a couple of examples already in space and going up soon. In fact one of them is Psyche, right? I think Psyche was loaded with an optical capability.  We have one that's going to the station very soon, ILLUMA-T. we could talk about O2O. can you talk about some of these technology demonstrations for optical comms and what you hope to accomplish by having several optical communications technology demonstrations on several different missions, in several areas of space, deep space, near space, everything in between. So what's the plan here?   [ILLUMA-T IMAGE] Jason Mitchell:  Well, you just hit the nail on the head, actually, right? We have a diverse user set that we have to support, and they operate everywhere. They literally operate anywhere and everywhere that they could go. And so the way we've constructed—and I'll sort of use this term sort of “risk burn down” right? Our goal is to burn down all the risk so that a future user doesn't have to accept any additional risk, right? Again, back to the notion of you don't want to take risk on a mission on your infrastructure, right? Unless you're specifically trying to do something new that you couldn't do without that. And that's sort of what we're doing here. And the portfolio goes from low-Earth orbit to GEO relay to the sort of cis-lunar and lunar environment, which instantly that was the feasibility piece, the LLCD, the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration way back in 2013 on the LADEE mission. We demonstrated that you could get an optical link from the Moon at about 622 megabits a second. Then DSOC pushes that out to beyond the Moon, right?  That DSOC is the what are we going to do for high rate communication, in particular in the focus of the Moon to Mars objectives, right? If we want to be able to really think about exploring more, we really have to make sure that we understand what it's going to take to have high-rate capability. And I don't just mean high-rate capability as return data. If we're going to have humans, humans have to be connected to home, right? I mean, you think this is maybe sometimes something that's glossed over or not talked about, or something like that. You absolutely need to make sure that if there's an issue on board the spacecraft with the crew, and it's a medical thing, you have to be able to, for example, maybe they have a portable small X-ray or CT SCaN capability.  That's a lot of data you’ve got to get back and you have to have that pipe to do it. But you also want to make sure that you can send them a lot of data because you like to make sure that they remain connected to home, feel connected to home, and don't feel isolated during that long journey. And so that's part of the reason why we're doing this now with DSOC, is so that we can understand what the link characteristics are for that context, for that use case, and work through it, and then think how we're going to do that, how we're going to expand on that to support the real exploration needed for Mars.  [DSOC IMAGE] And in fact, if you think about it, if you really want to pick a landing site for Mars, you kind of need to have a really high resolution map of the surface.  If you were going to say, “Roll the dice and look at the entire planet to find the best place you would want to go to,” well then potentially, you'd have to map the entire surface. And this is one of the things where as an early implementation, you could potentially return substantially more data and have a substantial risk reduction to your site selection for visitation, than if you didn't, if you had to wait, right? It’s pretty rare that you could get something that could move your schedule to the left, right? Usually schedule often moves to the right, right? Takes longer. But this is something that for the deep space side, could actually move things in, right?  From the near Earth perspective, I’ll mention one other demonstration we did. We did something called TBIRD, which is the terabyte infrared delivery payload that was on a small sat demonstration. And that hit 200 gigabits a second direct to Earth. It was in a Sun-synchronous orbit, so it was a about a five minute pass, twice a day from Table Mountain. In a nighttime pass, we managed to accomplish almost a five terabyte transfer in just that single pass. So that was a critical, and I suspect that still, that will be a record setting, downlink from a space link, from a LEO user.   [TBIRD IMAGE] Host: That's huge. Yeah you're talking about huge amounts of data. So to drill down just a bit more, when you talk about supporting users and from your perspective, within the organization of SCaN and how best to support that, what will that from your end, inform? Will it inform ground stations? Will it inform servers and how many servers to buy to be able to handle such data or staffing concerns? From a practical sense, in order to support operations, are some of the things that you are toying with in your mind say, “Okay, what does the future look like and how can I best prepare for it?”  Jason Mitchell: In short, yes.   [Laughs] Host: All of it.  Jason Mitchell: Yeah, mean, it really is because we're really shifting. It’s not just a shift in frequency to really high frequency capability. It really is a change in the way we would potentially operate. Because if you can get 200 gigabits a second, or nearly five terabytes of data down in a single pass from a small satellite, right? I mean a 12U satellite was this demo. The payload, the TBIRD payload itself was only about 3U in size, right? So it's pretty tiny. That sort of means, uh oh, what can I do that I couldn't do before? And what is the impact on the entire chain, right? And I say chain because I immediately start to think about not just the things that we need to do internally, as I mentioned before about the sort of how does that change the operations?  What does it mean? But it also extends to supply chain, right? To commercial availability of pieces that we would integrate together, right?  The way I see technology moving forward to be really successful, we have to do the things that are critical for our missions that are mission-unique. If it's not unique, then we just procure it, right? And then if we do something that's unique, we have to make sure that we transfer it to industry so that we can build industry capability to support that more so going forward, right? And then we can focus on only the unique mission needs that we have to invest in, because we'll know we'll have done enough risk reduction that commercial can pick it up and provide that as a capability. And the exciting thing now is that there's such commercial capability that it's not clear to me at this stage what things will look like in 10 years, maybe not even what things will look like in five years, right?  If we’re…I should say it differently. When we're successful with our risk mitigation, our risk reduction portfolio, that will be transition to industry and who knows what the capabilities will be once we're able to do that. I mean, that's something I'm really looking forward to and that's a little bit of a wild card, right? It could be, to your point about sort of sizing servers, like maybe it's all just a cloud service at some point in 10 years, and you buy it from whatever your cloud provider is, and they say, “Well, you don't have to care about how your data comes and goes, this is just what you need to do for your spacecraft point here when you're ready to go and turn on and we'll get the data to your ops center.” Pretty magical. Host:  Yeah, magical. And I’m starting to get a sense of the difficulty of trying to—I mean, what you're doing here, Jason, is predicting the future, right? So if you make the wrong investment, then of course, if you make an investment to supply a capability that delivers data to all these end users, but then there's already commercial infrastructure in place, well, then that's a wrong decision, right? So you have to understand what is out there and what everybody needs, right? There might be an end user that wants like terabytes of data instantly as soon as they receive it from the spacecraft. So do you set up a unique line to get it from that ground station receiver on the optical end over to the end user? Or is there a commercial infrastructure in place that maybe you can rely on and they could just purchase or lease services. This is sort of what you're going for. What from the SCaN perspective do we need to procure and invest in? And what is the total demands that may drive a whole economy that may support it for us and finding that balance? This is the world you live in. [Laughs] Jason Mitchell: Right. So if I had an infinite prognostication engine, this would all be easy, but I only have a very finite prognostication engine.  So the good thing is that we have a very strong team in SCaN that is thinking sort of very broadly about this. I mentioned earlier TDRS, so just as an example of how we're sort of trying to work all this out as we separate the technology development from what might be seen as just maturation or evolution of our existing service capability, right? In SCaN, one of the things that I mentioned earlier, I mentioned TDRS, so that's aging, right? And that will probably age out before everyone would like to see it go, right? That’s just a fact of life.  There are no plans to replenish TDRS. So they’ll fly out, they'll do their useful lifetime and then that will be it.  To mitigate that, there's a project inside SCaN called Communications Services Project and its job is to engage commercial industry, evaluate their capabilities to provide TDRS-like services so that we could potentially have users that have relied on TDRS in the past be able to just procure services. Because we are working with industry to mature those capabilities to reach that state. And so that's the kind of thing that we're working through to address exactly what you asked about. Well, maybe you just get it from a service provider, right? Bringing that commercial capability up to speed so that we are actually giving them more direct requirements, right?  I mean, it's a little bit challenging for us because we're sort of a challenging user cause we have unique mission requirements often. Again, I mentioned that specifically to meet some particular science or exploration goal, whereas a commercial provider would typically just say, “Well, here's our spec sheet. You know, this is what you're going to get.” We're working with them to try and expand that capability and that's sort of just one element of that evolution.  As we work also through tech transfers, you know, we do broad-area, broad-agency announcements that engage the commercial community and RFIs to test out ideas and see what things could come back so that we may, you know, write a procurement for something, so that we could address how we would infuse that procurement into executing a mission. So it’s the goal of SCaN to make sure that we're evolving to serve our existing users, but also evolve to meet our future user needs, which is why it's important for us to continuously engage them and get an idea on how is that horizon receding, right? Does it recede to a hard wall that we couldn't meet because the data needs become so high. I mean, I think we're already seeing missions that are targeting, you know, tens of terabytes or more a day, right? So at some point, we'll transition to missions that want petabytes of data and we have to be prepared at least with a plan about how we would accomplish that. And that's sort of how we work as a team inside SCaN to make that happen.   Host:  That is a tough job. You know, as you were talking, I was thinking about just what the investment that it was made in the beginning with TDRS and with other assets to enable something like an RF network that we've seen with the Near Space Network, Deep Space Network. And how many users have been using these assets for as long as they have. I would dare to say, and I wonder if you're observing the same thing, that it was because of those investments that drew up the demand for the services, so that now when we're in a period where we're evaluating what the future looks like, we could consider commercial not because what we did by any sense was wasteful. It was because it was necessary to drive up the demand to be where we are right now, to have this option where we can consider commercial because there is so much demand out there that there could be a viable business model around space communications.  Perhaps that's something that can trend over time, but it's because of the investments that have been made over time by NASA, by other organizations, to get us where we are today.   Jason Mitchell:  Yeah, I agree. I mean, maybe to put a broader point on, it's sort of like a field of dream scenario, right? If you build it, it'll come. The challenge is do you have the mission requirement that says you need to build this to execute the mission, right? This is the chicken and the egg challenge of reaching for and attaining the future that people, or at least the missions that we see coming, will have to have to meet their needs, right? And so I think that's the difficulty, right? The finite prognostication capability. The swiftness with which commercial was moving. Because as you rightly point out, there are business cases that close that are providing services that mimic what we have done because of that draw up, right? And I see what we're doing with the current risk mitigation portfolio for optical right now as sort of prepped for that next generation draw up of what that will mean.  From the Moon to Mars objectives targets for SCaN sort of being responsible for providing infrastructure for what a post-Artemis future would look like. You know, you hear terms like industrial utilization of the lunar surface, right? I mean, that’s kind of a scary thing, because we don't really have that many assets at the Moon and certainly not what you would need to support industrial utilization. Like if you think about what, for example, what three d printing for houses kinds of things do here, right?  Maybe you want to have some position capability at the Moon where you can tell where anything is to within a handful of centimeters on the Moon so that you could do appropriate control to do things like automated road building or automated house building or shelter building. And maybe house is a wrong term to use for the Moon, but some shelter, shelter building. That's a heavy lift, but it's not one that is without parallel. We did it here terrestrially. I think the terrestrial benefit has been undeniable, right? I'm thinking specifically about GPS here, right? I think the impact for that national investment is maybe not immeasurable, but it's a really big number. We all know that if you turn it off, people get cranky.   So you want to keep it going. And it's entirely possible that as we make these investments for the post-Artemis future, for an industrial utilization of the Moon, and by the way, a context that we would leverage to understand what we really need to do for Mars exploration, I think there's a lot of business cases that close for that to be able to provide services to users as that market would grow. I mean, we would model it much like we've done with our terrestrial services, right? We would do the things that we need to do to meet our mission requirements, transition to technology and the capability to industry, look to procure more capability as we grow to the point where we would have, you know, commercially owned and operated things, and we would just be a purchaser of service, much like we lease lines for fiber to be able to do backhaul here on Earth.  Host: So that's a big timescale that you're thinking of, Jason. You have to think about the near future. What can we expect in the next 10 years, 20 years? You're thinking about Mars, you're thinking about, you said post-Artemis, you know, this is a time period on decades into the future. And so when you gather your team and you start performing this work, how do you try to balance the immediate need? You talked about timescales of whatever capability we may need, maybe it's something we need to invest in now because it will take years to build up that capability. Where are your priorities now then looking at least when we're talking here in late ‘23?   Jason Mitchell: Well, so this is an excellent question, right? Because this is the challenge of the unknown future. There’s a Frank Herbert quote from Dune of something about the concept of progress exists to insulate us from the terrors of the future. Something along those lines, right? But it's really a challenge. It takes a lot of focused thinking and a lot of customer engagement, right? At heart, SCaN as a service provider to users. And so we have to continuously engage our users. Now, our users actually have the really long timescale. I'm thinking specifically about Artemis with its goals, the Moon to Mars Architecture objectives, which with its stated goals, and then the Science Mission Directorate for their science goals.  And the science side has the surveys that drive them, right? So they're looking at the next 10 years with a peak to the follow on for what could be important.  So we actually have a lot of data about what the potential futures are, right? As you pointed out earlier, you can't just pick one, right? That's the danger of a bad investment. And then you can't react, right? So you have to sort of keep your options open. So that's why we look at a number of things. We're never going to give up RF. So it's always going to be, you know, “yes and” kind of thing, right? And so I think that thinking and the available information and a process that we use,  which is our customer engagement process, helps us stay sort of on track and revector, right?   So we can look at the long future, take a shot, and if it doesn't land quite where we think it's going to land based on what we're seeing in the near future, we're able to correct it a little bit. I think maybe there's an interesting parallel here. If we look back, right? I like historical data cause historical data sort of gives us at least a low number of cases that we can use to calibrate our forward shots, right? And I think if you go back to one of the core elements of our ability to do optical communication right now, are these Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors, SNSPDs. Wouldn't be NASA if it was an acronym, and you said it fast. But these SNSPDs are at the core of how we're able to do optical comm because they can count individual photons, right? So that lets you be able to receive a really weak signal if you're thinking about throwing individual photons at this detector.  Now, if you go back to the early 2000s, there was originally a DARPA program that was looking at how do we do these kinds of detectors. There was sort of a, I'll call it maybe an eight year-ish investment, wasn't really clear how things were going to go. SCaN became interested in this and stood up a program, and we had, I think maybe it was five or six different technologies we were looking at that we were funding for development. As you do with low TRL, right? Low technology readiness level technologies, you don't know what's going to be the winner. So you have to be able to fund a number of them. Quite frankly, at the time the SNSPDs were the dark horse candidate. No one was really sure because what comes from this, right? The prefix of the superconducting part means we have to use a superconductor, which means that we don't have room temperature superconductors yet. So we have to cryogenically cool them to just a few Kelvin above absolute zero for them to get into a superconducting state. And so no one was really sure that that was going to be the winner. And of course, that's what we use now. And, and they're actually available commercially for relatively  low cost for what they do. So I think that's the point. You have to be able to have a far enough look ahead with some near-term corrections and the ability to do the low technology readiness maturation so that you can get to a down select and pick the winner based on merits. Right. A performance.   Host: Yeah. Okay. It's funny is we just had a conversation very recently on this podcast with NIAC, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts. Jason Mitchell:  Great program.    Host: Exactly. And what you're talking about is a lot of the world that they live in. This is looking at several different options with technologies in a low technology readiness level and seeing what works, right? And then of course, technology readiness levels increase. And to a certain point, they go out of NIAC and they get embedded into more different things. But this is a very important step to look at things that are conceptual because they may, as you say, have this capability and this to the future where they're used regularly, so regularly that they can be available commercially. A very important step to take. Jason, this has been a very insightful conversation on optical communications. I think there's a lot to do and I'm very curious the steps that are going to be made—as we've had this conversation now—over time, because we're talking about decisions on a grand timescale here. But over time, what is the space communications infrastructure going to look like?  How will we support initiatives like optical? What will that look like to navigate around things like weather and, you know, some of the considerations that are needed for making space mission successful? This was an absolute pleasure to get to talk with you today. Before we break, I just want to make sure that we did a pretty good job of addressing a lot of the things that you wanted to mention. I know you mentioned up top, you had a couple of things that you wanted to make sure that we hit. I feel pretty good, but I just wanted to make sure from you, did we hit everything that you wanted to hit today?   Jason Mitchell: Yeah, I mean, the under the underscore is just the thing that drives this risk mitigation portfolio is more data, means more discoveries. And sort of at the end of the day, my sort of internal drive is to help us learn as much as we possibly can about our universe. And being able to do these kinds of demonstrations and acknowledging that we don't really know what the future is going to be like Making these incremental steps is really important because we want to be able to leverage that technology and that technology development to drive that science and exploration, that knowledge gathering. That's just sort of the underscore. Host: It's the underscore that drives everything that you're doing right now. It’s very, very important work. Jason, this has been an absolutely fascinating conversation. Wishing you all the best, and thank you so much for sharing what you do on Houston We Have a Podcast. It's been a pleasure.   Jason Mitchell:  Thank you.   [Music] Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Hope you enjoyed this conversation with Jason Mitchell today.

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 174, “Sticking the Landing on Mars.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all kinds of experts about their part in America's space exploration program. And today, we take the next step in our “Mars Monthly” series. And we've talked about how to get a spaceship full of human astronauts to Mars, what they'd have to pack, how we would feed them along the way and when they got to their destination. Well, today we talk with two members of the Mars architecture team about the considerations for completing a successful landing of a spaceship on Mars. The subject is EDL, which stands for Entry, Descent, and Landing, not edit, decision, list. We have two guests. Doug Trent from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, is the Mars architecture teams Entry, Descent and Landing lead. Doug has been working on the Artemis Human Landing System program, HLS, for three years. So, he's tied in to how what we're learning from Artemis at the Moon is feeding into the development of the systems to use on Mars. Our second guest is Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo from the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. She is the de-orbit descent and landing mission segment lead for the HLS and a member of the EDL team for NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate. Alicia has been embedded with the Mars architecture team for years and has served on several Science Mission Directorate robotic mission teams. She actually has firsthand experience landing something on Mars. She was on console during the Mars Curiosity landing in 2012 and the Insight mission landing in 2018. On this first Friday, our eighth episode on how to get to Mars. Here we go.  [ Music]  Host: In listening to the “Mars Monthly\" series, I've learned so much about a number of aspects, what it takes to complete a successful trip to Mars, the emphasis is on successful. And I've come to realize more clearly how hard this is going to be. How much has to go right. How much smaller is the margin of error than it is for flights closer to home. But today we're focusing on one critical aspect, landing a spacecraft with humans onboard on the planet Mars. So, for both of you -- and Doug, if you’d start us off -- what makes landing on Mars so challenging?  Doug Trent: Yeah, sure. So, a lot of times you hear about the seven minutes of terror and that seven minutes of terror really refers to the rough amount of time that's required for our vehicles to go from atmospheric, entry interface, basically, where the vehicle just starts to enter the Martian atmosphere, all the way to touchdown. Like everyone else, we're basically watching the vehicle perform the landing sequence autonomously, however, because it takes anywhere from five to 20 minutes to receive those signals from Mars, we typically only get information about the landing after it's actually already physically happened on the surface of Mars. So, a lot of us are really just sitting there, almost in terror, clenching our fists, hoping that the landing went as planned. You know, so Alicia has some details that she can share on that too.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Yeah, having been able to have the opportunity to sit through two landing sequences, you can hold your breath for seven minutes. It's a little terrifying. But, you know, we spent about eight years for the Mars Science Laboratory, designing that seven minutes, with a large group across the agency and with different companies. So, you know, a lot of -- a lot of design and work goes into just those seven minutes making sure that we -- we get it right.  Host: And there are some terrific videos that have been made too, to give us the look at what that probably is like, as it's actually happening, that the seven minutes part of it is the amount of time it takes for the vehicle to actually make the transit through the atmosphere to the surface, is that right?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Correct.  Host: And it's terrifying because -- for you because you have to wait or because of what the vehicle is going through in the process?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Both. So, a lot of what we -- try to plan for all the things that we know the vehicle will encounter. And then we try to design additional robustness and margin into all the things that we -- know we don't know as well as the things that we don't know, we don't know.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You know, we -- by the time it gets to the surface, we have to make sure that, you know, we've accounted for all of those. And you never know until it actually happens if -- we did it. So, as many times as, you know, that we've sent the rovers, every time, it's a different set of scenarios and a whole different environment that you encounter. So, we never really know until we get that signal back that says, it's landed.  Host: There's lots of different kinds of science that are involved for you guys to figure all this out. And so, one of my questions, Alicia would be, how did you get interested in this line of work in the first place, I mean, what kind of paths of your interests or education and experience brought you here?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: So, one of the things that got me interested was in 1997, NASA landed the first rover, Sojourner, on the Fourth of July, and I was in college at the time trying to decide what I wanted to do after I got out of undergrad. And I started watching it. It was one of those first missions where you could, you know, track its progress every day on the internet. And the things that it would learn each day, it was like Christmas, the new -- the new rocks it would explore.  Host: Right.         Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: The new places it would go was the first time we'd ever got to see that. And it got me interested in, hey, that would be something really fun to do. And so, when I got out of undergrad, decided to go to -- switch from physics to engineering as a major. One of the programs that I looked at was the George Washington University where you could take classes at a NASA research center and work on projects like this. And here it was about five years later, I was hired into this -- the same branch at the center who worked on delivering that mission to the surface.  Host: Outstanding. Doug, what about you? Give me a brief tour of your education and experience?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so for me kind of like Alicia, actually, it certainly wasn't planned, it was more just kind of walking along the path as it presented itself. So, I mean, as a child, I grew up, my parents would always put me in front of the TV to watch, you know, space shuttle launches and things like that to try and keep me interested and excited in space. But as I went through school and got into college, as I was working on my undergraduate degrees, I really didn't have that much of an interest of getting into space, it wasn't necessarily I didn't have an interest, as much as I didn't really think I had the capability to do it. It wasn't until I got my first opportunity to really get involved with space, interning at the Marshall Space Flight Center, basically doing life support systems development, testing for the space station. Doing that work really showed me like, oh, wow, I can actually do this. And this is absolutely amazing work that everybody's doing. And I really wanted to be a part of it. And so, that really kicked off the next roughly six-year journey for me going through finishing my undergraduate work in mechanical engineering, and then moving forward into my graduate studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I focused on systems engineering. And so basically, that focus on systems engineering is what's really led me to where I am today, you know, supporting the Mars architecture team doing Entry, Descent and Landing lead. So basically, taking a step back from the mechanical engineering roots that I started with, and really focusing on that big picture. You know, landing on Mars obviously takes a lot of different things happening in concert all at once to get the job done. And so, having that systems engineering background, to be able to take a step back and really look at all the components that are playing into this, just really, that background helped me get to where I am today, but also, I just have found this really strong love of, you know, looking at the really big picture instead of the nitty gritty detail. And so, that's a little bit of how I got to where I am right now.  Host:  Terrific. Now, you know, most aspects of human spaceflight come with various elements of risk, when we're trying to do something that the human body is not built to do naturally on its own. Alicia, you've got experience landing a vehicle on Mars, so you're conversant with some of those risks. But I wonder what risks are there that, you know, robotic mission are things that you can accept, that you would not accept for landing a vehicle that has human beings onboard?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Yeah, it's a very challenging problem. They are -- they're not the same. And I'm really now, just now starting to appreciate the differences for what it takes to accommodate crew onboard. But really, want to break this down a little bit because, you know, we have the difference between landing robotic and human missions, but there's really understanding the way that we -- we've landed the robotic missions, and so far or for the past two decades, NASA has sent really two classes of missions to -- robotic missions to Mars. Lander missions. And there's the 300-kilogram landers, which is kind of Mars Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity, Phoenix and Insight. And then there's the Curiosity rover and the 2020, Perseverance rover that are both about 900 kilograms. So, that's a three times increase in mass. And we had to change a lot of technologies just to get -- just to deliver, you know, that three times more massive vehicle.  Host: More so than just tripling up whatever you had done?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right? It doesn't -- it doesn't just scale --  Host: OK.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: -- the way you would expect it to. So, through the analysis we determined that we couldn't use the technologies like the airbags or the small retrorockets that Spirit an Opportunity used, we needed a bigger heat shield, that entry -- that protect it during entry. In fact, we had -- we built the biggest one, we could fit into the buildings, right? We had this limitation. But you know, now that we're talking about sending humans to Mars, we have to completely rethink those technologies. The parachutes aren't big enough to deliver the large masses that we need. So, just going from the 300 kilograms up to the 900 required us to change quite a few elements in our technologies. And then thinking about, you know, what it's going to take to deliver humans and, you know, now we're talking maybe 20 metric tons of payload.  Host: Wow.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We can't even -- right, even the things that we wanted -- that we designed and upgraded for the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, you know, now we can't use the parachutes, we can't use the retro rockets, we need something different. And so, we're looking at what it would take to do that. And it's a whole bunch of different technologies like, inflatable structures, and, but they still have to fit into launch vehicles. So now, when you add crew, we can't have things like I mentioned, the parachutes, when it deploys, it results at a very high g load on the vehicle. So, like up to nine or 10 g's, which crew doesn't want to have to experience. So, we're looking at ways to redesign the entry guidance’s and entry vehicle path through the atmosphere to reduce those g's to something that the crew can survive. Plus, it's also a little bit much -- much more comfortable ride on the way in. So, it's those kinds of things that we have to take into account. Especially when you have crew on -- crew onboard.  Host: I didn't realize that the difference would be quite so big if you went from like 900 kilograms to 20 metric tons. But in both cases, you're trying to land a payload safely. It's just that one of them has living people onboard. The other one, it has a robotic payload. Is there a significant kind of difference in how you work out those risks or is it a completely different set of calculation?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Well, one of the other primary differences is that with all the robotic missions that we've tried to land, they -- several of them have been ballistic. So, which means, you know, we don't control them on entry. And so, we land where you land and that usually requires very large, flat rock free areas, so hundreds of kilometers in diameter. And so, we don't get to pick exactly where it lands, for Curiosity, we -- and then for Perseverance, we will be able to -- we were able to steer it much -- the first time we had a guided entry for those vehicles. And we were able to reduce that hundred-kilometer diameter footprint on the surface, you know, where we -- it could have landed down to about 10 kilometers in diameter. So the difference for -- when we add crew onboard is that now, the crew isn't going to want to walk very far to get their stuff and what the architecture setup is that we deliver all of the vehicle, all the crew logistics, their supplies and their ascent vehicle and everything before they ever get there. So, they know it's safe on the surface.  Host: So, now you have a -- you have a matter of trying to target the landing of your human crew close to their supplies, which you've sent on ahead.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right, exactly. They don't want to walk very far to get there. So now instead of landing in ellipses where we think, you know, we can get there within 10 kilometers in diameter, we're now talking about landing in something that's one kilometer in diameter. And even the way that the technologies that allow us to do that, we're actually still developing. They're the precision landing sensors, where you have to put them, when they have to turn on so that we can actually see, you know, where you're trying to go and where you're targeting on the surface.  Host: Now, I understand that the actual spacecraft that's going to land people on Mars has not yet been designed. Doug, is it possible to give me a sense of how big or how heavy you think that vehicle is going to be? Or compare it to what's already been landed on Mars?  Doug Trent: Yeah, absolutely. So, I noticed that a lot of what you were saying before, you know, you were shocked a little bit about how much mass that we're saying it might cost. And a lot of that comes from the fact that humans tend to be pretty needy payloads, there's a lot of stuff that they need to be able to survive in the environment base on Mars. Things like life support systems, you need water to drink, you need food to eat.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: You need someplace to live and sleep and work out of, and so all these things come together to really increase the amount of mass that we really got to deliver to Mars compared to what we would need for a robot which, you know, typically doesn't need those things.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: So, Alicia kind of alluded at it. Previous payloads landed on Mars, you know, we've had a couple hundred kilograms with a lot of our rovers. And recently, we've been, you know, putting down rovers that are upwards of one metric ton. But basically, a lot of our current study suggests that human class landers are going to require a capability to land roughly 20 times that, so on the order of 20, 25 metric tons, per lander, onto the lunar surface. And --  Host: So, it’s --   Doug Trent: These missions actually are going to, I was going to, well --  Host: What I was going to say, is that -- a similar number for the first vehicle, that's coming delivering supplies, as well as the one that's got the actual people in it?  Doug Trent: That's correct.  Host: OK.  Doug Trent: So, each Mars mission, right now that we look at, we're typically looking at around three 20-ton landers to do the mission. So, you'd have two landers delivering cargo before you land the third one with crew, and even that third crew lander is going to have some additional cargo on it.  Host: Right, right.  Doug Trent: So typically, when we're looking at these three lander architectures, the first one is going to land things like maybe your surface power systems, potentially some additional propellant for your ascent vehicle, that will actually take the crew off the surface. And then the second lander is right now, typically designated for that actual ascent vehicle. Because, you know, typically, we like to bring our humans back home after a mission.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: And so, we have a full lander, typically dedicated to that vehicle that does that process to get them back off the surface of Mars. And then finally, the third one, once we've got everything in place, all the cargo, the landers, we've got, you know, our ascent vehicle, we've got a check out from it from Mars, it says it's ready to go, it can come off the surface with the crew, then we'll send our crew out and actually land them on the surface of Mars with again, another one of those 20 ton landers.  Host: Does the increased size or maybe the shape of the vehicle or something, does that make a difference in how -- in the degree of difficulty it is to land it softly, if -- we can say it that way?  Doug Trent: It does. So again, like Alicia was saying, you know, some of the previous technologies that were used for landing, some of those robotic rovers, like, airbags were basically, you know, they just go on a ballistic trajectory, they kind of bounce around and roll around on the surface and they land where they land, not terribly precise, if we're going to be landing multiple landers in a small area, so that they don't have to walk terribly far to get it. Obviously, that takes some different technology, as well as like she said, the parachutes tend to induce some pretty significant load on the vehicles during decent, those are so high that we really can't subject astronauts to those levels. So, we've got to come up with new technologies and new methods to basically land these kinds of payloads on Mars to support that. So currently, the designs that we use, what we're looking at is basically employing two key technologies to really help us scale these landers up to this new delivery mass that we need. So, the first technology that we employ is a Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator, HIAD for short, is typically what we call it. And basically, what it is, is it allows us to get a much larger diameter to do our initial entry deceleration in the launch vehicle constraints that we have. So basically, you know, we're fixed on diameter based on the launch vehicle that we fly on maybe, in some cases, it might be an 8.4-meter SLS fairing --  Host: But you're talking about the diameter of the vehicle itself, the part of it, that is going to be leading the way through the atmosphere?  Doug Trent: Correct. But actually, what we'll do is we'll inflate large toroidal type sections of the vehicle that kind of come out and deploy to get a vehicle diameter that's much larger than the primary structure of the vehicle upwards of 16 meters. And so, that's going to give us the surface area basically to slow down initially, when we start impacting the atmosphere, and that'll help slow it down. Not as fast, so we don't induce those huge loads that we would see via a traditional parachute.  Host: You mean you're going to ease on the brake? You mean you're going to ease on the brake?  Doug Trent: Right.  Host: Instead of slamming it.  Doug Trent: Ease on the brake. Got to be nice to our human payload.  Host: Right, OK.  Doug Trent: The second component, obviously is going to be -- we don't want to rely on just an inflatable airbag approach where we bounce on the surface and roll around because it's just not going to be a very conducive way of landing sensitive payloads, but also humans. And so, the second component is basically a supersonic retro propulsion technology. And basically, what that's going to do is once we've extracted as much energy as we can, by using the thin atmosphere that does exist on Mars to slow the vehicle down, we're going to have to do a little bit more to make sure that we get that soft touch down, similar to like what we had in the Apollo days with a -- you know, a soft touchdown in the lunar lander on the lunar surface.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: And so basically, what we have is this supersonic retro propulsion component of the landing system that will basically perform the last little bit of propulsive work to basically get that very soft touchdown on the surface.  Host: Neat. Alicia, are there other technologies that you guys are trying to incorporate into this that you didn't have for the robotic landers?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Absolutely, in order to meet our precision landing constraints, you know, so that the crew doesn't have to walk so far. We can deliver them without, you know, running into any other pre deployed assets.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: What we will use are a whole bunch of sensors. And right now, we're studying whether we can keep those sensors onboard the entry vehicle, or if we need to preplace beacons on the surface or in orbit. But essentially, what these sensors will do is, tell us where we're at and how fast we're going as we're flying in -- into the landing site. So, we have what we call terrain relative navigation sensors, which are cameras, that we take images of the surface as we're coming in and compare those to onboard surface -- onboard maps of the terrain, to tell us exactly where we are and how fast we're going. We also have, as we approach the landing site, we have a navigational -- Doppler lidar, which will tell us again, our velocity and altitude, and help arrange how far away we are from the site. And then as we get really close, we -- we're anticipating and right now advancing technologies so that we can have a lidar that will take an image of the surface right where we want to land and tell us where the rocks and the hazards are, so that we can basically avoid them with the hazard detection sensor. And while none of these have flown on any of our vehicles, yet, Perseverance will be the first mission to demonstrate using the terrain relative nav system.   Host: Cool.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: So yeah, we're testing these things now, so that we can expand on them and help for future -- help the future missions.  Doug Trent: I obviously am closely tied in with the Human Landing System that NASA is currently working as well. And so, our HLS partners are currently developing lunar lander systems as part of the Artemis program to land humans back on the Moon. Now, obviously, we like to try and invest in technologies that can be applicable in other places. And this is definitely these landing sensors and these precision landing systems is something that, you know, if we're going to build a sustainable lunar presence, being able to land multiple payloads, again, in a very tight area together, so that they don't have to walk far to go get their payloads on the lunar surface. That kind of technology is very directly applicable to here on Mars. And so, we actually have a lot of commercial partners currently developing lunar landers that are going to employ these kinds of technologies that will be directly applicable to, you know, future Mars missions too. So, it's definitely a great partnership that we have with commercial industry. It's something that not just NASA is doing all on our own, we definitely have support from you know, companies like SpaceX, or Blue Origin, Dynetics, all developing landers right now under the Human Landing System program to help further these technologies along with us.  Host: And it only makes sense to make the best use of all the knowledge that you have.  Doug Trent: Absolutely.  Host: The one thing -- in the things that you've described, there was one thing I was kind of listening for, and I didn't hear, how do you -- especially with the human landers, and you've talked about the reasons why you want to land it fairly close to all the supplies that have been sent ahead. But so, how do you steer that thing in order to get to that smaller target area? If you've got a large enough ship to be carrying the human crew of, we don't know how many yet, plus, whatever supplies you're bringing along, moving at that kind of speed, how do you, do you steer it to head it toward the site you've identified?  Doug Trent: Right, so it's definitely a lot of planning ahead of time, before we go and actually initiate any kind of descent. Obviously, there's always going to be a little bit of uncertainty in terms of how exactly do my engines fire? Do they fire for the exact amount of time that I, you know, have commanded to do so? And so, those are going to introduce some errors. But you know, making sure that, you know, we have technologies and components in place that can basically execute the command as we tell them to do so, so that we get nearly as close to what we predict. Now, obviously, like I said, there's variations and so, we do have secondary, basically reaction control systems. It's basically a second propulsion system on the vehicle that basically will provide control of the vehicle during these key descent maneuvers. So, both during the aerodynamic deceleration, but also during the final retro propulsion. The second propulsion system helps orient the vehicle as it's doing these maneuvers to make sure that we stay on track as we go in for our final descent landing. And all of this is getting informed and happening in concert with these precision landing technologies, all of the -- the optical observations that you know, cameras are taking pictures of we've got maps of Mars that are pre-loaded onto the vehicle so that what it's seeing and what it expects to see it can try and line those up. And all this is happening -- in concert to make sure that we get those very precise landings that we need to really execute these missions.  Host: And so, it seems -- sounds to me, like the biggest part of that steering is to be aimed properly when you launch at the right place and at the right time.  Doug Trent: Absolutely.  Host: There have been ten -- if I've got that right, there were ten, successful landings of payloads on Mars from Earth, I don't know how many from other planets, but eight by the United States, two by the Soviet Union back in the ‘70s. Alicia, how valuable is the data from those uncrewed robotic missions? How -- successfully landing on Mars, how valuable is that data in helping you develop the current EDL plans?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: It's very important, what it's helped us do is provided ten trajectories, paths through the atmosphere that tells us what the atmosphere is like at each of the different altitudes that we passed through. Now, granted, those are for a specific time, season, location. So, they -- they're a very limited data set. But for -- in some regions of the atmosphere, it's all the data that we have. What makes them even more valuable is that missions like Opportunity and Spirit and Curiosity, they've been on the surface at a location where we know exactly where they're at, for years. And most -- the rovers that are there all carry a science package that allows them to measure the density, temperature and pressures at the surface. And that really informs our -- some of our atmosphere models so that we can -- the orbiting spacecraft will be able to correlate data with that. It provides, so, there's two spacecraft right now, Mars Odyssey and Reconnaissance Orbiter, two U.S. spacecraft, and then there's the Mars Express, the European one that are taking data of the upper atmosphere all the time.  Host: OK.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: And so, that we can correlate some of that data to the -- with the surface measurements, and then it can inform our model development and our -- that we use for the design of the future missions. So, there's some regions of the atmosphere where we just don't have any data. And that's, you know, we -- use that to inform future mission planning, as well as future mission design, what kinds of missions could we send, whether it's flying ones -- so there's a helicopter that's going to be flying on -- Mars 2020. That'll give us a new opportunity to look at different atmosphere in different regions that we haven't been able to at this point.  Host: And you're talking about meteorological conditions. The one that I know anything about is dust storms, we hear about dust storms on Mars a lot. What kind of challenge do you face if it's time to land on Mars and there's a big dust storm going on?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Well, until recently, we said we won't land if we're in orbit. [Laughter]  Host: We'll wait. [Laughter]  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We'll try to wait it out. Right? And so, for most of the year, it is not global dust storm season. And so, that would be a reasonable assumption to make. There are times when you do get those global storms that do take months to decay. But what we -- what we've planned for so far is that you could stay in orbit and wait. The problem is really, it creates a level of uncertainty that we just haven't been able to understand and measure because just the atmosphere on a -- on a clear day is -- has uncertainty in it, and variability that we have to plan for. Adding in the additional complexity of a dust storm, which essentially, what it does is it heats up the atmosphere so that all the density is at the higher altitudes, and there's lower density near the surface. So, it just makes, you know, most of our models aren't set up to capture the full variability that that could entail, we don't have a lot of measurements during that. So, it's really just as an uncertainty in the mission design and planning that we would like to avoid. The other challenges that -- and some of the global storms where you just can't see the surface, it does make using those precision landing sensors a challenge. So, there are lots of things that we would like to avoid with that. The other challenge is that with our capability in our data that we have so far, we can -- we can forecast weather on the surface of Mars for about a day. That's about how good we can predict ahead. So, it would be OK if we were in a say a one soul, one day of Mars orbit around it and only took 11 hours to get once we deorbit from that -- from that to get to the surface, it would take 11 hours. We think we'd have a pretty good estimate of what the weather at the surface would be, where if we decided to be in a larger orbit, say a five soul or an orbit that takes five Mars days to go around, it would take a two and a half day -- days to get from, you know, once you deorbit back to the surface take two and a half days. Well, since we can't predict out that far, that also adds an additional uncertainty.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We're trying to identify what -- what information we would need to improve those prediction models. So that, you know, would enable that kind of prediction capability for those types of missions. But right now, we would like to say we'd like to avoid landing in a dust storm. But if we had to, then we'd have to add additional robustness to the system in the way of extra propellant, or, you know, we'd have to -- we'd have to --  Host: To be able to wait.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right.  Host: Yeah. One important part -- got to be an important part of the consideration for this has to be the location on the surface, like where on Mars do, we want to land? Doug, can you give me an idea of what are the characteristics of a good landing site or a perfect landing site?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so choosing a landing site is actually quite complex of a task. There's a lot of factors that go into play. For our -- for the robotic landers, the previous Mars missions, there's really always been a very clear science objective that's been defined in partnership with, you know, lots of NASA scientists. However, when landing humans on Mars, there's some other considerations that come into play. Obviously, we want to do science and things like that. But one of the largest things that has to be defined is, you know, what are we going to do when we get there? Are we going there because we want to do human exploration? And so, in that case, we might be landing in one spot want to do some scientific exploration in that area and then land in a completely different area on the planet to do science exploration somewhere else. That's one way. Another one might be if I'm hoping to develop a longer-term human presence, maybe a Mars colony perhaps, the latter, so that Mars colony is going to require a site rich in raw resources, which can be refined to use -- and utilized for further developing the colony. So, things like ice so that we have water developed. And we can convert that into air to breathe, you might need, you know, a site rich in specific minerals and things like that, that I can refine into resources to actually build structures and things like that. So outside of these questions obviously, there's also the performance related part of it. So, in terms of selecting the landing site, not all landing sites are the same in terms of how they impact the design of our vehicle. So, things like surface condition, how soft or how hard is the surface that we're going to be physically landing on? How many rocks and boulders are there? And how far are they dispersed or how close are they together in the potential landing zone? What's the slope, the elevation of the local terrain? Is it you know, perfectly flat? Or maybe is it kind of like a little foothill that we're landing near or maybe even on? All these play a role in the design of the actual lander itself. However, basically, landing is not the only component. So obviously, we're here talking about how we -- how do we stick the landing? But unfortunately, taking it back on a more systems perspective, landing isn't the only component. So obviously, with our crew, like I said earlier, we want to bring them home. And so, ascent is another portion of the mission, very important part of the mission to get our crew home. And unfortunately, the landing site selection and how that impacts the ascent vehicle, might not be the same as how it impacts the descent system. And so, you know, for instance, in terms of the landing vehicle, I would prefer the land -- the landing system at as low altitude as possible. And that's mainly because I'll get a more dense atmosphere, it allows me to slow down better. And so, I can have less propellant, basically. However, the ascent system would prefer to land on top of the highest mountain possible, because that just puts me that much closer to orbit, which then it requires less propellant. So really --  Host: But then you'd have to walk down the mountain, you have to walk that mountain to get to it.  Doug Trent: Yeah, absolutely. And so, it's just basically highlighting the fact that there's this trade amongst the various different components so that the lander isn't the only component in a Mars mission, there's a lot of other things that go into place. And so, for me, an ideal landing spot would be something that's flat, has a nice hard surface, so I don't have to worry about my landing gear sinking into like a really dusty surface or something like that.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: Large enough that I can land several vehicles in close proximity. So, like you said, top of a mountain, probably not a good idea. And really only a small amount of smaller rocks. So, I don't have to worry about maybe a landing gear, you know, hitting a large boulder or something like that, or maybe a larger rock that puts me in a weird tilt when I land or something like that would be not ideal. And lastly, I'd like it to be close to at least some useful resources, particularly something like water ice, that can be useful for, you know, life support, drinking and things like that.  Host: Particularly if it's an early mission, where you're going to have to be setting things up from scratch.  Doug Trent: Right.  Host: You don't want to have to go far to get them.  Doug Trent: That's, that's true.  Host: I can understand as you say it that there are so many different things to take into account that it's -- where you want to land is not a simple answer. And, one of the big parts of it, as you noted, is that it depends on what you want to do there. So, that's all part of the stuff that you guys have still got work to do to figure out in the years to come. One thing we didn't talk about that I want to now, as we've considered all these elements, and kind of try to synthesize it, is to flesh out the human detail for me. If we all three were strapped into the Mars vehicle and headed down for the surface, Doug, can you give me a sense of what it would look like, and sound like and feel like as we rode through the Martian atmosphere to the surface?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so unfortunately, I have not had the chance to fly on a space shuttle or maybe land on the Moon.  Host: Yeah. Not yet.  Doug Trent: Yeah, not yet, maybe someday. So, it is a little bit challenging to say how it might look and sound inside the vehicle. But we can definitely make some educated assumptions or guesses on how that might look. So obviously, the design of the crew cabin is going to have a huge impact on what it physically looks like and sounds like, you know, the materials that it's made of, how big it is, all these things are going to play a role in how that might happen. However, with the design of the current Entry, Descent, Landing system, there is a bit that we do know that it's going to be similar to. Based on the design that we have right now, it's going to be very similar to both a shuttle landing and a lunar landing, you kind of get components of both. So, this is because, you know, like I said, the initial parts, were definitely entering an atmosphere, going very, very fast. And so, you've got that component very similar to a shuttle, how it reenters the Earth's atmosphere, obviously, it's going hypersonic and so, you're going to get plasma buildup and things like this. So, any kind of windows that you might have, you're going to see just fireballs out the windows, similar to any kind of reentry during Earth. So, we would expect to see similar kinds of events while landing on Mars, and, of course, the sounds that would accompany those kinds of things. However, unlike a shuttle reentry and landing, the shuttle lands -- basically glides down back to the surface and lands on the runway. However, like we were talking about, again, we're going to have a hypersonic retro propulsion, supersonic retro propulsion system, where we have to basically turn on engines to do the final little bit of landing. So, that's where basically the more like a lunar landing component comes in. So obviously, we're going to have the sounds of you know, pumps spooling up to start moving propellant, you're going to have engines igniting, all the good sounds that comes with a loud, powerful, rocket engine igniting and so, you'll have that component as well, that's maybe a little bit different than the shuttle system. Now, the crew is going to experience acceleration similar to those experienced by the shuttle astronauts. And that's not just random, that's by design. We obviously have a very good understanding of the limitations of the human body under acceleration and have designed the lander and the descent profile to basically provide that environment such that it's not too extreme for the astronauts. However, we are still working with our medical community on the -- finer details. So, things such as seating orientation, you know, are they going to be sitting upright like we sit in a chair here on earth? Or is it going to be -- or is it going to be more of an inclined position to better accommodate the acceleration load? So, for instance, you know, we might lean them back at some kind of angle to put their back towards the vehicle so that we have a good, large surface on their body to impart some potentially higher loads. So, things like this, we haven't really nailed down yet, and it's still under study, but we're obviously working with the various communities necessary to kind of flesh these details out.  Host: One of the things that it occurs to -- me you'll also, when working with the medical community, you got to consider the fact that these astronauts who are about to land, have been in a weightless environment for many, many months now. And they may be a lot weaker than -- than they were when they launched.  Doug Trent: Yeah, that's absolutely correct. I mean, right now, the missions that we're looking at, it could take months, basically, to get the astronauts to Mars. And, you know, we've seen from astronauts coming back from the space station all the time, you know, they'll land wherever they land. And typically, we have a whole host, a whole crew of people from Earth to help them out of the vehicle and move them to, you know, whatever transport vehicle to move on after they've landed. That's something we're not going to have on Mars. And so, that deconditioned state of the astronauts, when they get to Mars is certainly a very large concern that we have -- ideally, they'll be able to get out of their chairs, the size of these landers and how tall they are, they're likely going to have to probably crawl down a ladder or something of that sort to be able to get to other assets that might be on the surface, like a rover or other payloads like this. So, a lot of it right now, the approach is, well, when they land on the surface, we'll give them a certain amount of period, maybe it's a few days or a week or so to basically conditioned to that new environment, basically the Mars gravity, to hopefully, give their bodies enough time to at least kind of get their walking legs back underneath them to basically execute the mission.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: But that's a good point. So, what -- so, that means that the -- whatever they land in has to have everything that they need to live for that amount of time.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: And we've talked about being able to maybe just deliver the crew in something like an Orion capsule, or you know, something, a smaller vehicle, and then have them get out, but because of this deconditioned crew environment that they will be in, we do need to have them land in something that's got all the things that they will need to live for that long before transferring.  Host: Right. Alicia, you've already landed robotics on Mars before. Have you thought what it'd be like the first time you can land something that's got human beings inside of it?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You know, back when the movie “The Martian” came out, they had all these different ideas of how to, you know, as we're designing these and we're looking at, you know, how can we use our imaginations to figure out how all the different parts could be interchangeable? Or if something did go wrong, how would, you know, address that? You know, so it's, you know, getting out and looking for the first time, this new planet that we haven't ever, you know, looked at with our with human eyes, we've done it with robotic eyes a lot of times and try to just imagine what that would be like, I think it comes back to the engineers on also imagining, you know, what could go wrong with the systems that we're building and how we could, you know, make sure that -- they're robust to a wider range, because we just don't know what it's going to be like. So that's -- that's part of the challenge and it's also part of the fun.  Host: Yeah, to be able to figure out how to do something that people have been thinking about doing for generations. It's got to be a really cool job to have. Alicia and Doug, this has been terrific to hear your perspective on this. Thank you, very much, and good luck, with the work.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You're welcome.  Doug Trent: Thank you.  [ Music]  Host: I recently saw the episode of the streaming series, in which the crew module with five astronauts onboard made its descent through the Mars atmosphere. And they did, I thought, a pretty good job reflecting the seven minutes of terror that those humans landing on Mars are going to live through on their way to history. Great talk today, to get some level of detail and see what the NASA engineers and scientists are working through to develop the systems that will safely put our astronauts down on the planet Mars in the years to come.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 64, Space Weather.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be host today.  So, in this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on right here at NASA.  So, if you're familiar with us, you'll know that we recently just completed a five-part series on the hazards of human spaceflight.  One of those topics was on radiation and Dr. Zarana Patel gave us a great perspective on what's going on and what we're doing to learn what happens to the body when exposed to space radiation, especially for long periods of time.  So, today we're exploring what's being done right now to document radiation exposure, not only to make us-- to make sure our astronauts are healthy, but to really understand it.  So, Dr. Steve Johnson is one of the senior scientists of the space radiation analysis group.  Does not only that, but designs hardware, conducts physics modeling and 3D modeling and uses data to plan for future missions.  But first I wanted to start with Dr. Patel, who gives us a nice overview of why studying this is so important.    Dr. Zarana Patel: So, to date, there are four health risks from space radiation exposure that we identify.  The first one is cancer, the risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis and that includes epithelial cancers and leukemias, and this is actually the biggest contributor to this permissible exposure limit that-- that's the standard we set for our astronauts.  The next one is the risk of in-flight and late CNS decrement.  So, CNS is central nervous system, and basically it's the risk of behavioral or cognitive decrements, either in flight or late post-mission, which can manifest in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.    Host: Oh, wow.    Dr. Zarana Patel: In this one, we're targeting pathology that can have commonalities between those disorders and cardiovascular disease, which brings me to the next risk, which is the risk of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease.  But it's not just cardiovascular disease, it includes things like cataracts and other degenerative tissue effects, such as immune decrements, respiratory and digestive dysfunction, early aging or premature aging.  And, finally, the last one is the risk of acute radiation syndromes.  This is really a specific one for solar flares or what we call solar particle events.  So, this one is a more intermittent, but large-dose exposure from a solar flare and you have things like skin burns, prodromal responses, nausea.  This one is fairly effectively shielded against.    Host: That was a clip from our first episode on the hazards of human space flight, radiation, but today we're diving deep into our real-time operations dealing with radiation and space weather with Dr. Steve Johnson.  So, with no further delay, let's get right to it.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host:  Thanks for coming today, Steve.  This is an interesting topic.  I'm calling it space weather, but it's-- I don't think it's exactly what it sounds like.  When I think of weather, I think of rains, clouds, I think of thunder, but space weather is a little bit different, isn't it?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, it's a little different, yes, but it's similar in that it's a changing environment.  In this case, rather the changing environment of the atmosphere around us.  We're looking at how the environment is changing in space around us.  And, in this case, what the parameters that are changing are charged particles, magnetic fields, the solar wind-- a lot of different parameters, but in the end it's the charged particles and the radiation that we're most concerned about and we want to monitor how that changes with time and what drives us-- what drives all of these dynamic changes or changes that occur at the sun on various time scales.  And so we want to be kind of solar physicists in a way, but that's what starts the cold front and warm fronts or whatever, if you will.  They have the influences to change how the space environment changes around us.    Host: Really, so it's mainly an environmental thing.  The changing environment, that is the weather, but it seems like the sun is the primary source of that weather.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yes, it is.    Host: OK.  So-- and you said-- I guess we'll start with radiation because radiation is probably one of the more significant things that you're looking at.  Right?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, that's our primary purpose is for-- we want to monitor the radiation environment for crew health purposes, for radiation health and protection.  We also advise the flight team when there are changes in the environment that may be of concern to people that have, say, hardware that are-- might have-- are sensitive to radiation, but our primary focus is working within-- at least for the operations crew within the space radiation analysis group.  The operations portion, that's our primary focus is to watch out for the crew.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And actually it kind of turns around the other way.  A lot of times it's watching out for the flight control team because everybody hears radiation and everybody goes hysterical.  You know?  And so a lot of times we're-- more often than not, we're preventing radiation hysteria and saying no, this isn't a big deal, just calm down and this is-- this is fine, you know, we don't need to do anything.  And so, more often than not, that's our story then the sky is falling.    Host: Yeah, exactly.  And it's not so much, you know, we have to worry about the folks here on Earth, it's the folks here on Earth worried about what's going on in space.  We've got a nice little protective bubble, the magnetic sphere, right, that keeps us kind of safe.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Between the atmosphere and the-- Earth's magnetic field, we get a lot of protection.  And the space-- and the space station gets a lot of protection from the magnetic field.  Most of the time we're protected.  Maybe say 95% of the time we're protected by the magnetic field and there's only 5% of the time that we intermittently kind of slip out from underneath this radiation protection umbrella and can see free space radiation and so those are the intervals of times that we're most concerned with.    Host: Interesting.  Yeah, we've talked about radiation before on the podcast, mostly from the biological perspective, but not so much from the operational.  The day-to-day, you know, here's what we're doing every day to make sure the crew is healthy onboard.  So, I kind of wanted to start with because radiation is such a big part of space weather, diving into that.  What is radiation?  Let's start there.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, radiation generally is-- in a generic sense, it's transferring-- it's transfer of energy.  In the case-- in our case, in our specific application, radiation are-- is composed of charged atomic nuclei.  Usually they're fully ionized, so they don't have any electrons.  And they have very high kinetic energies and they will move along at high velocities until they encounter matter of some sort and then they will have interactions primarily with the electrons of the substrate and then they will slowly give up their kinetic energy and when people become that mass that they're slowing down in, the energy is transferred to the electrons and the electrons are what create all the bonds of all the big molecules, so we're disrupting those bonds.  And when that's your DNA, if you disrupt those bonds, you're disrupting the cellular code and you might kill the cell outright or you may have some artifact that's been modified but still stable enough to be passed on to future generations.   And it's that type of damage that becomes-- the damage of highest concern is that some stable alteration in the DNA code could be carried on.    Host: Wow.  So, it's not really something you feel, kind of, an ever presence thing.  It's something that's small but high energy and has a lot of impacts over time.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, that's right.  It's-- you can't-- you can't feel it.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah.  So, is a lot of it, you said-- like you said, coming from the sun, but is there-- is there a part that's galactic cosmic rays, anything other than the sun too?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, the sun gives us the short bursts of radiation that-- of high-- well, there's always-- there's always charged particles coming off the sun and that's called the solar wind and it's benign.  It doesn't have the sufficient energy to be of concern ever.  It's just the short bursts that we get during solar proton events that protons are accelerated at high enough energies that they can penetrate the spacecraft and penetrate into the person and give them some exposure.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Normally, day-to-day, we have two primary sources of radiation.  One is the trapped radiation belts or the Van Allen belts, if you will.  Those are mostly trapped protons, trapped electrons, and we pass through a certain region of the orbit where that belt comes close to the Earth.  And we pass through that about six times a day.  And then the rest of the time it's just kind of this background radiation which is from the galactic cosmic radiation.    Host: Ah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And the source of that is from outside the-- outside the solar system, throughout the galaxy, maybe particles even from galaxies far, far away.  And they just have very-- you know, created maybe during supernovas and these nuclei are being accelerated at very high energies and much higher than the solar protons or the trapped radiation.  They're very, very penetrating and they're also-- it's about 90% protons, so you have 10% that's not protons.  And, as the atoms get heavier, they are capable of doing more damage biologically.  They're of more concern and so when we start leaving Earth's-- low Earth orbit to be in free space, whether you're on the moon or on the way to Mars, the GCR-- galactic cosmic radiation-- the GCR exposure is increased and becomes more of a threat that, you know, we might exceed what our current limits are.   There's no reprieve from this chronic low-level radiation that's very damaging and that becomes a big concern for those types of missions.    Host: You said daily dose of radiation is coming from the ever-present galactic cosmic radiation.  It's still not a lot because of the protection we have because we're in low Earth orbit versus being out-- deeper out into space.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It's modulated, so it's-- I don't know, maybe a third or a quarter of what it would be if we were in free space.  That's the total amount of GCR that we receive while we're in low Earth orbit is about a third or a quarter of what it might be in free space.    Host: Now, I didn't realize that the-- I thought the space station was pretty low, but it seems like it's peeking out into little bits of the Van Allen radiation belt ever-- a couple times a day you said, right?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, you can't-- the only way you can avoid the-- that region of the trapped radiation belts that comes down real low is known as the South Atlantic anomaly.    Host: Ah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And very conveniently, it is located over the South Atlantic near South America.  It's slowly drifting west with time, so I guess they may have to rename it after a few decades and-- but-- because it will be in a different position, but that's part of the weakening of the magnetic field.  The only way to avoid the trapped radiation is to fly at low altitudes and then you're flying where the atmosphere is thick enough still that it really reduces the amount of radiation from the trapped protons.  But if you go to higher altitudes, you get increasingly larger trapped doses.    Host: Yeah, 250 miles above the Earth is a pretty nice spot.  It's high enough where you don't have to really worry about atmospheric drag too much, just a little bit, you have to reboost every once in a while, but it's low enough where you're getting a decent amount of radiation protection.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It works both ways.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: OK, less-- you know, the atmosphere being like-- the atmosphere being an influence on satellite drag, it's also a drag on protons, on the space radiation, so you have less satellite drag, you have less drag on the protons, so you really start having higher doses.  So, there winds up to be this trade that if you want to fly really high and not have reboosts because you're trying to avoid the drag of the spacecraft-- on the spacecraft-- you wind up getting more dose.  So, there is a-- there is a trade there that spacecraft drag wins in the pocketbooks.    Host: Yeah.  So, let's go into what your group does, the space radiation analysis group.  It's got quite a lot of different, I guess, areas that you're focusing on, but one of them-- one of the ones is the-- is what we mentioned up front, which is just the day-to-day operations of what's going on aboard the space station.  So, what are you doing to monitor the-- what's the radiation environment of the International Space Station?    Dr. Steve Johnson: We go-- we-- we're part of mission control and we go in every day.  We report to the flight surgeon and the flight director.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And we go in every day and fire up our systems and make sure everything is running right, make-- check on all our instruments.  We have a half dozen radiation instruments that are on the space station.  We check on their status, check on the data trends, check on the space weather, what we see.  We coordinate with a group in the-- with NOA, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  They have a group that's called the Space Weather Prediction Center, which is kind of like the national space weather service, if you will.  And we talk to them-- and they're the experts-- and we compare notes about what we see for trends and it's up to us to kind of take what their total outlook is and apply it to our specific situation with our mission.  We also-- besides checking our instruments, make sure our computer codes are running, up and running.   Check on just the normal admin for being part of mission operations.  What's happen-- just what's happening, you know, on the ground or what the crew schedule is and such things and put that all together.  And then we're on-call.  We have two people that are always on-call every day and we're supposed to be able to respond back within 45 minutes if we get a page and one of our-- one of our systems is a server that is ingesting space weather data and if it pulls in values that are above thresholds that we've established, then we get email notifications which tells us to come in and NOAA SWPC, space weather predictions center, will also give us a call and let us know.  So, we have a little bit of redundancy in terms of how we get notified.  We have one server is prime.  We have another server that's doing the same job, but just checking to make sure the first one's running so it'll send us a note if it doesn't-- if the prime was not running.   And then the Space Weather Prediction Center has its own email and they follow up with a phone call.  So, we're not likely-- and we have two people, so we're not likely to miss a call in.  So, that's kind of our ops work in a nutshell.    Host: Nice.  So, this-- I'm trying to think about-- you said space weather and you'll get notified if something is happening.  What are some of the events that would be happening that you would get notified and says hey come in in 45 minutes?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, the primary thing would be for what we would call an energetic proton event and that would be a situation where an event has occurred on the sun and normally that event is a coronal mass ejection.  There's a couple ways to accelerate protons, but the ones that really generate the events that are the big threat to us are generated by the development of a coronal mass ejection and as that coronal mass is-- becomes disconnected magnetically from the photosphere and starts to rise, there's a shockwave that goes through the corona and accelerates the protons and then that's what arrives.  But, as that develops, there's a lot of energy that's being released across the, you know, electromagnetic spectrum.  There's big-- there's large x-ray flares, which becomes our first indication that something goes on-- that something's occurring.  You know, why-- you know, we get a page if it's above an M5 flare.   So, we have to go and look and see, well, why did we have that flare?  Is that something of importance?  Is it of-- is it at a location on the sun that's important or not?  And if it is important, we'll probably also have radio bursts, called type II radio sweeps, radio bursts, type IV, 10-centimeter bursts.  I like to refer to them as Dr. Pepper events, 10, two, and four, but if we get those-- and that's usually an indication collectively between a large x-ray flare and the radio burst that there is a proton event occurring and then with our knowledge of-- our situational awareness of where the regions are on the sun and what's the probable threat, we know pretty quick whether we might see protons, you know, quickly or slowly, but we kind of have a feel for being able to anticipate at that point and can respond.  And then when we cross those thresholds, SWPC also lets us know.   So, the Space Weather Prediction Center is letting us know the details of the flare, about where it is, how big it was.  If they think the protons are going to come up, they have a code that they run that helps try to predict what the probability is just based on the parameters that have been active with the flare as-- at the onset of the event.    Host: So, when-- I'm guessing you're getting this data all the time.  What do you see normally?  Is it kind of going off in all different directions and don't really have to worry about it coming towards Earth very frequently?    Dr. Steve Johnson: That's an interesting question.  There's a couple variants of that.  One is the sun is usually not very active, so--    Host: Oh, good thing for us, I guess.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, but it makes it boring for us.  You know?  Today's forecast is boring to mostly boring.  There's no sunspots on the sun today.  But on the threat end, just when something does occur, it can have a pretty wide longitudinal distribution in terms of influence.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Even though-- well, we have our best magnetic connection to somewhere on the western hemisphere of the sun.  So, if something happens there, we can have protons here almost right away.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: If it's on the east side of the sun, we may get protons, but it may take a day or so for them to get above our action levels.  I mean we can see them slowly trickle up, but they're so far away they have to diffuse across the magnetic field lines of the sun and that just takes a while.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, in some cases we're directly connected, in some cases we're not so connected, but the influence can be very wide.    Host: Wow, that's kind of scary to think that something happening on the west hemisphere if-- you would see the effects almost immediately.  So, there's-- in that case, I guess, operationally there's nothing much that you can do?  You can't, you know, shelter in place or anything?    Dr. Steve Johnson: If-- when we're-- well, we have a very good example of one that-- such an event occurred back in January of 2005 and it's a good illustration.  The protons were arriving before the flare had even finished peaking, so that was unusual just in that fact alone.  Plus it was the highest protons that-- for a particular energy band that we looked at.  Energetic protons were higher than they've been in the space program, so we had all this occurring at the same time.  Now, the thing was is that the crew happened to be on orbital paths that it was not slipping out from underneath that protection anytime soon, so we had eight hours to-- for the orbit to process before we would have the risk of the crew being-- encountering extra exposure from the sun.  And so they had just gone to bed, so we didn't do anything.   There wasn't any shelter for them because there's no-- there wasn't any influence from the event because of the orbital track.    Host: I see.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so by the time they got up, the event had decayed a lot and so they just let them do their normal business, which is, you know, working in the lab and such.  The lab is pretty well shielded, so it's a good place to be during an event.  It's a good place to be working so we can continue our ops, you know, we don't want to stop ops, but, you know, if we need to do that, we, you know, we can make that recommendation.  But anyway, we were protected most of the time, so there's this factor of where you are in your orbit that-- that's our first question when we realize something's going on is where are we in the orbit and are we approaching one of those regions where we slip out from being not protected and so we start counting down when that's going to occur because that's when if we were going to do some sort of shelter sort of thing, if you will, that's when we would need to take that protection.  And that protection would only be for maybe 10 minutes every 45 minutes for a few hours during the day.    Host: Yeah.  When you say orbit, do you mean the orbit of the space station around the Earth?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yes.    Host: So, depending on that position, maybe the-- are you thinking the Earth is going to maybe protect the space station and the crew a little bit more?    Dr. Steve Johnson: No.  It's all the magnetic field.    Host: It's the magnetic field.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The magnetic field of the Earth is not aligned with the spin axis, so it's tilted.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And it also doesn't intersect at the inner-- at the center of the planet and so it's-- that offset is-- well, that's part of what-- that tilt and offset is what creates the South Atlantic anomaly that we talked about earlier.    Host: I see.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But it also lowers the amount of magnetic protection over the north-- northern part of North America over Canada, that's not very well protected.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And if you get over the Indian Ocean, west of Australia, that section in the Indian Ocean, when we cross those geographic points, we're crossing into areas that are not magnetically protected.    Host: I see.  So, that's your first question.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so that-- so that is, you know, are we approaching those regions and if we're not approaching those regions, then we're protected.  Even if there's an EVA and we had a big proton event going, if we're not crossing those specific zones, then there's no danger, if you will, from the proton event during those--    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Until you do that.    Host: So, how much of it is watching out and watching the crew health and how much of it is watching the vehicle health?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Our role is to-- is crew health.    Host: Crew health.  So, what are you doing--    Dr. Steve Johnson: We just provide notification.  We just tell the-- we just tell the-- I mean the flight director knows anyway.  We say, oh, we're on recall because we had a-- we've got a proton event going on.  So, we go in, once we have an energetic proton event started, we're on 24-hour coverage.  Before, our daily-- our normal routine, we only go in for the mornings just to check on everything and then we're just on-call for the rest of the day and the weekend.    Host: I see.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But once we cross those thresholds for the protons, then we are there 24 hours.  But we will remind the flight director, oh, well, we have a proton event, you should notify the other flight control centers so that everybody knows.  So, if somebody's got equipment, you know, just put out that everybody-- just put out as a note that everybody can see when those times are and it's up to them to protect their equipment if they need to do that.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But our purpose is the-- strict-- is primarily the crew.    Host: Yeah, and providing information to the teams and the crew.  Are you watching the crew's radiation-- I guess how much they're absorbing over time?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, we make estimates about what we think they're going to receive during the course of their mission.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And then we monitor it daily.  We can't really-- we don't really monitor what their dose is exactly.  We monitor what the levels are.  So, if the dose rates are higher than we expected, then we know they're probably getting a little more dose than what we projected at the beginning or vice versa.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And-- so we watch those trends.  We watch for those trends to see if there's a change throughout the mission and once the mission is over we have some idea what the total radiation was just based on the instruments.  But more specifically, each crew member has a radiation badge that they wear, a personal dosimeter, and we get that back down when they arrive on the ground.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And then that gets analyzed and that gives us the value that will go into their medical records.    Host: OK.  OK, so it's documented, I guess, your total career exposure.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yes.  It's tracked for all their-- each flight there'll be an entry for what their exposure is.  We track it-- we track their exposure in terms of percent risk and not necessarily so much dose.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so our limits are really based on risk levels.    Host: OK.  So, the limits would be-- I mean if you've flown in space x number of times and been up there x number of days, maybe you have-- you've absorbed enough radiation where that's probably your last flight.  Is that kind of how it works?    Dr. Steve Johnson: You could get to that point, hypothetically.    Host: OK.  Yeah, no, I mean there's astronauts with hundreds of days, so I know it's like-- it's not.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It's a function of-- the risk factors vary as you get older.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And it varies between the sexes.  Women are more radiosensitive than men.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And young people are more radiosensitive than old guys like me.    Host: Really?  The younger you are, the more sensitive you are to--    Dr. Steve Johnson: Right, because you've got your cells are turning over more rapidly and so you're going through more cell generations.  Whereas when-- as you get older, cells turn over much more slowly.  So, if you have some damage to a cell, there's-- it takes longer to go through those number of generations before you might see that effect, if an effect was to occur.  The other part is is that time in your life is that we also-- you can also kind of think of it as loss of life, so to speak, quality of life.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: If you're, you know, a 40-year-old astronaut and, you know, there's some cancer takes 40 years to develop once you've had some, you know, event occur, well that makes you 80.  Well, people live to be 80, so you're really kind of still kind of in that zone where that is kind of like a loss of quality of life impact.  Whereas if you were 60 years old and flew and takes 40 years for it to develop, you're 100.  Well, are you really having a quality of life issue at that point?  Well, no, you've kind of-- you're out there where, you know, most people don't live, so you're-- it's not really a loss of life effect, so to speak.  So, as you get older, there's less time in front of you for, you know, a cancer to develop or some cardiovascular sort of issue to develop.    Host: I see.  So, for a radiation perspective, you're looking at flying senior citizens.  Not so much?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Maybe not.    Host: There's a lot of other factors besides radiation, isn't there, for what makes an astronaut successful?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah.    Host: So, I mean you're watching career exposures.  You're talking about some of the dosimeters and some of the hardware actually measuring these dose rates, both on the astronaut and you said there's six-- you said there's half a dozen--    Dr. Steve Johnson: I said there's about a half a dozen.    Host: About a half a dozen.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It kind of changes a little bit.    Host: So, what are the instruments and what are they doing?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Oh my.    Host: Big question.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, I should have brought a list.  Well, let's start with the simple things.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The radiation badge sort of dosimeters, they use what's called TLDs, trans-- thermoluminescent dosimeters and they're little crystals that are radiation sensitive and you zero them out, if you will, fly them, let them get exposed, and you bring them down and then you read them.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, yeah, but-- so you don't find out any information while they're flying.  You only get the data once you get them back down to the ground and analyze them.  And we change those out about twice a year.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, every six months we make a measurement.  So, it's-- it just kind of gives us an idea of what the average dose is for the six months at different locations.  So, you have the same type of measurement over a half-- over-- I don't know, a couple dozen locations.  We're reducing that slowly because we've characterized the station well enough that we can just kind of go to a few reference points and keep track of the trends.  The crew also has a badge that's similar to that, so that goes up with them and comes down with them and we read that.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The workhorse that we have is-- it's a-- it's known as a tissue equivalent gas proportional counter.  And that's kind of our workhorse.  It gives us-- it gives us the amount of-- the radiation dose rate.  It's telemeter data, so we're talking about an active instrument now.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: An active instrument-- when I say an active instrument, that means it requires electrical power of some sort.    Host: And you're getting data more frequently.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And we get data telemetered down every minute from it and so that allows us to check what the exposure rates are during proton events, so we're watching to see it, you know, how much it goes up when we hit those zones where we're not really protected in the orbit.  It also has a dose rate-- a high dose rate alarm for the crew.  If for some reason weren't in communication, they would at least get a-- some notification that there is a radiation event going on.  So, we had two-- we had two of those on-- we have two different models on station.  We also had some-- what are called charged particle telescopes, which are a series of silicon discs, wafers, not very thick, but a stack of them.  And so each one is a separate sensor and you line them up and it-- and you watch radiation as it goes, penetrates that stack of detectors and look at how much energy is deposited in each of the sensors.   There may be as many as, I don't know, 10 sensors, and we had a-- we've had a couple internal instruments that are of that type of design and we have one external instrument that had three units in it that's located outside.  And we've also got these newer instruments that-- they're about the size of little-- of a oversize USB stick that sticks inside the-- the instrument itself sticks into the side of a laptop and it's also a silicon detector that's-- when I say a silicon detector, I don't mean it's detecting silicon, I mean it's-- the material is silicon and you're watching the radiation as it hits the silicon.  And it's a semiconductor, so it's basically kind of like a big diode and so you're watching the signal that comes off, how much energy's being deposited in that silicon detector as, you know, the-- as the day goes on.   And so we have-- we're kind of shifting over to those because they're much-- they're much more compact sort of instruments than the tissue equivalent proportional counter-- TPECs as we acronymize them.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The mass and volume are very important when we start considering going to the moon and to Mars, so having these larger detectors doesn't make sense from a mass standpoint, so we're kind of shifting over to using these smaller detectors and having those spread out around the station instead of the little passives.  For a variety of reasons.    Host: Yeah.  Seems like there's a lot of instruments, a lot of data, a lot of recording, a lot of monitoring.  Is there a database that you're keeping track of with all of these things?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, we can go back and-- I mean I do it frequently when I'm analyzing old events or whatever.  I can always go back and pull up the data from any of the proton events that we've had or at any time and look at what the trend was, what the background was for whatever purposes I'm trying to analyze.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And we can do that for all of our instruments.    Host: Is there-- is there any sort of predictive models where based on the information you have you can make guesses on what kinds of space weather is going to be happening or is it really just kind of reactive?  It just-- that's just the way it is.    Dr. Steve Johnson: In terms of space weather, we're really in what would be called a nowcast situation.  So, we have to watch things evolve.  However, we have situational awareness that allows that-- we try to develop the skill to now when we have high threats and low threats and most of the time it's easy to discern that it's a low threat because these proton events and what leads to them are very, you know, specific sort of situations that aren't-- don't develop frequently.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, from that standpoint, we have to, you know, on a day-to-day basis it's nowcasting.  But overall, for the solar cycle, there's a cycle effect on what the dose rates are to the-- to the crews of the station and so as the sun goes through its cycle of being from solar min to solar max, the dose rates are changing as a function of that.  And so, based on where we are in the solar cycle, we may adjust what we might project for their dose rate for their mission.  And we have some models that try to do that, but it's not an easy thing to do.    Host: What's solar min and solar max?  What's happening there?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Part of the sun's dynamics is it goes through this long-term cycle that we call the solar cycle and it goes from a period of time when there is virtually no sun spots, no features on the sun, and we call that solar minimum.    Host: Minimum activity.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Minimum activity.  And the-- what's happening is the sun's-- I was amazed when I-- when I learned this.  The sun's magnetic pole is reversing every 11 years.    Host: Whoa.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so, as it goes through this process of reversing, kind of in the middle of that process when it's kind of-- kind of more toward being neutral, if you will.  It's not really neutral, but kind of in the middle of that, that's when we start having all the hot-- a large number of sun spots and active regions on the sun and the sun is prone to producing these proton events.  And then that's solar maximum.  And then the field continues to flip and we get back to a solar minimum.  And so, from minimum to minimum, your magnetic polarity reverses.  And to get it back to where it was to start with, you really have to go through the cycle twice to get the pole to flip again.    Host: Yeah, that's right.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so there's even and odd cycles.  Well-- in conjunction with that activity, there is-- there is a way-- there's-- the output in ultraviolet in a particular wavelength changes between solar min and solar max and that wavelength is ultraviolet and it's readily absorbed by the atmosphere and it causes the atmosphere to expand.  So, when we go to solar minimum, we don't have as much of that UV radiation coming in and being absorbed by the atmosphere and the atmosphere cools and contracts.  And that makes for less spacecraft drag.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so, when-- during solar maximum, that ultraviolet output increases, atmosphere expands and becomes drag on the spacecraft.  So, that's why we have this solar min solar max drag on the spacecraft sort of thing.  And just as I mentioned earlier, drag on the spacecraft is drag on protons, so when you have less drag on the protons, the dose goes up.  The more drag, it goes down.  So, during solar minimum-- it sounds backwards, but during solar minimum our dose rates may be twice as high as they would be during solar maximum for our day-to-day doses.    Host: Because you have less atmospheric protection because it's--    Dr. Steve Johnson: Because-- yes.  Yes.    Host: Wow.  That is-- that does sound kind of backwards, but then I guess--    Dr. Steve Johnson: And it also-- on a larger scale, it's not due to the ultraviolet, but over-- - due to the activity of the sun and the solar wind and such.  You also wind up having the same sort of cycle on the galactic cosmic radiation that it also is higher during solar minimum periods than it is during solar maximum periods.  So, solar minimum are-- we have our highest doses and then solar maximum we have lower doses, but we have the risk of these short bursts from proton events that may add to the crew exposures.    Host: Is it the-- is it the increased activity in the sun during solar maximum that's sort of pushing away the galactic cosmic rays?  Is that what-- is that kind of what's happening there?  Or is it something else?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, in a way.  It's the solar wind and a combination of a few things that, you know, the-- you know, the particles are coming from very far away and they see-- you know, there's just a little bit of influence and it changes and it just-- this far into the solar system, it does make a big difference.    Host: So, this makes me think about deep space missions.  If you were planning a deep space mission, from a radiation perspective, what's the right time?  What's the more appropriate time to send people out to-- let's just say we have gateway around the moon to send people to around the moon.  Is it during solar minimum or maximum?  Does radiation even play a part in the planning?    Dr. Steve Johnson: It does play a part in the planning because we have to address the issue.  Does it determine the timing?  Well, if you want to make this a long-term project to be on the moon and go to Mars and not just have one shot sort of things, then you've got to just be able to deal with the risk of the exposures.  Going during solar minimum times, you're getting a lot more exposure from the GCR and that's not-- that's not a good thing, so we have to find ways to kind of try to minimize that dose somehow.    Host: Right.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It's not easy to shield, but, you know, you go to Mars, you've got a big spacecraft, got a lot of mass, so maybe using that mass prudently, maybe you can give yourself more protection.  You get a little more protection on the surface of the moon because you've got the planetary body giving you, you know, some sort of shielding.    Host: Sure.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But you have to consider it, but I'm not sure you can say one's a better time than the other.  You know?    Host: What about the risk of solar flares or coronal mass ejections?  Do you have to-- would you want to travel during a minimum just to avoid the off chance that you could be affected during transit?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, the thing is is that the solar proton events are easier to shield.    Host: Really?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Because they're lower energy.  So, you can make a shelter, if you will, that can make a significant impact on the short-term events.  So, in some ways, you know, the better time to go might be during-- if you're just trying to pick one time, you know, solar maximum may be a kind of a better time because--    Host: Lower overall dose, maybe?    Dr. Steve Johnson: That-- the low-- the background radiation levels are at their lowest, which is what you really care about, and then the short-term bursts that are maybe high dose rate, you can shield against them.  Plus their-- the damaging capability of the protons is not the same as the higher atomic number of species that you have in the GCR.    Host: So, are you looking at mostly low Earth orbit when you're looking at all this data for radiation and monitoring the crew health, or are you really looking further out into space, you know, beyond the Earth, maybe towards the moon, Mars, in-between, to understand the environment for deep space missions?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, I think we get a feel for what the environment is in general.  I mean specifically we're flying low Earth orbit, so our application is for low Earth orbit, but it's also-- we know what's happening here locally and the moon's not that far away, really, so what we see here is-- would-- is also same thing for the moon.  So, whatever our practices are in terms of monitoring-- kind of in the cislunar neighborhood, we're good.    Host: That's good.  Yeah, you don't have to rewrite everything.  Yeah.  That's good.  What-- and now for Mars, I'm assuming it's just going to be a little bit different.  Maybe communication is an issue because if a solar activity happens, you have to deal with the communication delay.    Dr. Steve Johnson: That-- we're not-- we're still kind of working through how we might want to deal with such things.  We also need more longitudinal monitoring of the sun from other angles because what we see here on Earth may not be what's being influencing a spacecraft on it's way to Mars or at Mars.  So, it may-- you know, more resources are going to be needed in order to be able to do some-- to do-- just to monitor the space weather so we can do our forecasting and analysis and keep the crew advised.    Host: So, are you talking about like satellites and probes to go out kind of towards different areas and fill in those gaps?  OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Be able to see the sun from different angles.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: We had that opportunity over the last decade or so that we've had what was called the stereo mission, which sent a pair a of space weather monitoring spacecraft, one ahead in orbit and one kind of lagging the Earth orbit and going around the sun very slowly.  It took a decade or so to get to the far side of the sun and then they switched and now they're kind of coming back.  But, that other perspective of the sun-- we need to be able to see from those other angles to really-- to do the right job to support a Mars mission.    Host: So, thinking about that-- and we can sort of wrap up with this idea-- what sorts of other gaps do we need to fill to make a deep space mission, like a one to Mars, successful?  Especially from a radiation perspective.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, I think the physics-- we kind of know the physics.  So, we know-- we have the type of technical information to work on shields and maybe try to optimize some shield designs to try to provide a little bit of more protection.  The big question-- and I think we can respond to the short-term influences of proton events and such, but the big question is going to be the effects of the chronic exposure to the galactic cosmic radiation.  The radiobiology, I think there's just a lot that we still don't know.  That doesn't mean we-- I don't know that that stops us from going, but-- I don't know that we'll ever have all the answers, but I think trying to get a handle on some of that is a very big challenge.   Exposures to-- I mean we understand that-- well, I say we understand-- I mean-- radiation and cancer, that's kind of understood in a way.  I mean it's a stochastic process in that it's random whether you get an exposure and whether cancer develops, but some other things-- some other effects-- there's not really a good way to quantify them and-- for example, the neurological effects, getting radiation damage to your neural systems, what, you know, neurons don't grow back very quickly.  You know?  So, if you wind up killing off neurons here and there, that's not good.  And there may be other effects that are-- maybe with time that, you know, we'll know more about, but I think they're still hard to quantify, some of them, and those will always be a-- those will always be a challenge I think that's going to be hanging out there to understand.    Host: That seems to be a theme is there is so much that we don't know and that's the-- I guess the beauty of science is the more you learn, the more you realize that there's more to learn.  And-- but that should never stop you from exploring and I think that's what's awesome about NASA is you just kind of keep going.  You keep pursuing and it's this drive to explore that keeps us going out further.  I love it.  So, thank you, Steve, for coming on and talking about space weather and radiation, opening our eyes to this-- I guess not-seen part of spaceflight that's essential to understand to make it successful, so I appreciate you coming on.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah.  Well, it is kind of an unseen thing.  We sit in the back room and nobody sees us as we come and go.  I could go throw in a story for that real quick.    Host: Yeah, do it.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Just to finish on a-- maybe a fun note.  I was-- I don't know, I think it was the fourth of July and I was in on the holiday.  We-- because at the time we went in every single day and-- like I said, we sit in a back room, so we're never really seen.  And gone down to the Coke machine and get something to drink and the flight director comes out of the bathroom and she walks up and she sees me standing there and looks and are you-- are you one of the radiation guys?  And I go oh, yes, yes, yes, she knows who I am.  Yes.  Yes, I'm one of the radiation guys.  She goes is it a bad thing that you're here?  No, no, we're just here for our regular shift.  She was concerned that there was some proton event going on and it wasn't going to be a quiet day.  So, OK, no.  It's a nice day on the sun.    Host: All right.  Well, I guess maybe soon it will be a good day whenever people see you come out of the back room a little bit.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.    Dr. Steve Johnson: OK.  Thank you.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Dr. Steve Johnson.  We talked about space weather, radiation, and really understanding the sun and how that affects our day-to-day operations for human space flight.  We talked earlier about the hazards of human space flight.  We have a couple episodes on those, five to be exact, plus a little intro.  So, you can go back and watch-- or listen-- to those episodes.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 278, “Sticking the Landing on Mars.” I’m Gary Jordan and I’ll be introducing this episode. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what is going on in the world of human spaceflight. We’re continuing with our reboot of our series that outlines a human mission to and from the Red Planet. The eighth episode unfolds the intricacies of accomplishing a successful landing for humans visiting the Red Planet. Houston We Have a Podcast host Pat Ryan had a chance to chat with the experts on this very topic. This episode was recorded on November 17, 2020. Let’s get started.   (Transition to original episode)   Pat Ryan (Host): The subject is EDL, which stands for entry, descent, and landing, not edit decision list. We have two guests. Doug Trent from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, is the Mars architecture team’s entry, descent and landing lead. Doug has been working on the Artemis Human Landing System program, HLS, for three years, so he's tied in to how what we're learning from Artemis at the Moon is feeding into the development of the systems to use on Mars. Our second guest is Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo from the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. She is the deorbit descent and landing mission segment lead for the HLS and a member of the EDL team for NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate. Alicia has been embedded with the Mars architecture team for years and has served on several science mission directorate robotic mission teams. She actually has firsthand experience landing something on Mars: she was on console during the Mars Curiosity landing in 2012 and the Insight mission landing in 2018. On this first Friday, our eighth episode on how to get to Mars. Here we go.  [Music]  Host: In listening to the Mars Monthly series, I’ve learned so much about a number of aspects of what it takes to complete a successful trip to Mars – emphasis is on “successful.”  And I’ve come to realize more clearly how hard this is going to be: how much has to go right, how much smaller is the margin of error than it is for flights closer to home. And today we’re focusing on one critical aspect: landing a spacecraft with humans on board on the planet Mars. So for both of you, and Doug if you could start us off, what makes landing on Mars so challenging?   Doug Trent: Yeah, sure. So, a lot of times you hear about the seven minutes of terror and that seven minutes of terror really refers to the rough amount of time that's required for our vehicles to go from atmospheric entry interface, basically where the vehicle just starts to enter the Martian atmosphere, all the way to touchdown. Like everyone else, we're basically watching the vehicle perform the landing sequence autonomously, however because it takes anywhere from five to 20 minutes to receive those signals from Mars, we typically only get information about the landing after it's actually already physically happened on the surface of Mars. So a lot of us are really just sitting there, almost in terror, clenching our fists, hoping that the landing went as planned. You know, so, Alicia has some details that she can share on that too.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Yeah, having been able to have the opportunity to sit through two landing sequences, you, you can hold your breath for seven minutes. It is a little terrifying. But, you know, we spent about eight years for the Mars Science Laboratory designing that seven, seven minutes, with a large group across the agency and with different companies. So, you know, a lot of, a lot of design and work goes into just those seven minutes making sure that we, we get it right.  Host: And there are some terrific videos that have been made, too, to, to give us the look at what that probably is like as it's actually happening.  That, the seven minutes part of it is the amount of time it takes for the vehicle to actually make the transit through the atmosphere to the surface, is that right?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Correct.  Host: And it's terrifying because, for you, because you have to wait or because of what the vehicle is going through in the process?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Both. So, a lot of what we, what we try to plan for is all the things that we know the vehicle will encounter. And then we try to design additional robustness and margin into all the things that we, we know we don't know as well as the things that we don't know we don't know.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You know, we, by the time it gets to the surface we have to make sure that, you know, we've accounted for all of those. And you never know until it actually happens if, if we did it. So, as many times as, you know, that we've sent the rovers, every time it's a different set of scenarios and a whole different environment that you encounter. So, we never really know until we get that signal back that says, it's landed.  Host: There's lots of different kinds of science that are involved for you guys to figure all this out. And so one of my questions, Alicia, would be how did you get interested in this line of work in the first place? I mean, what kind of paths of your interests or education and experience brought you here?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: So, one of the things that got me interested was in 1997, NASA landed the first rover, Sojourner, on the 4th of July, and I was in college at the time trying to decide what I wanted to do after I got out of undergrad. And I started watching it. It was one of those, those first missions where you could, you know, track its progress every day on the internet. And the, the things that it would learn each day, it was like Christmas, the new, the new rocks that it would explore…  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: …the new different places it would go, it was the first time we'd ever got to see that. And it got me interested in, hey, that would be something really fun to do. And so when I got out of undergrad, decided to go to switch from physics to engineering as a major, one of the, the programs that I looked at was The George Washington University where you could take classes at a NASA research center and work on projects like this. And here it was about five years later, I was hired into this, the same branch at the center who, who worked on delivering that mission to the surface.  Host: Outstanding. Hey, Doug, what about you? Give me a brief tour of your education and experience?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so for me, kind of like Alicia, actually, it certainly wasn't planned, it was more just kind of walking along the path as it presented itself. So, I mean, as a child, I grew up, my parents would always put me in front of the TV to watch, you know, space shuttle launches and things like that to try and keep me interested and excited in space. But as I went through school and got into college, as I was working on my undergraduate degrees, I really didn't have that much of an interest of getting into space: it wasn't necessarily I didn't have an interest as much as I didn't really think I had the capability to do it. It wasn't until I got my first opportunity to really get involved with space, interning at the Marshall Space Flight Center, basically doing life support systems development and testing for the space station, doing that work really showed me like, oh, wow, I can actually do this, and this is absolutely amazing work that everybody's doing, and I really wanted to be a part of it. And so, that really kicked off the next roughly six-year journey for me going through finishing my undergraduate work in mechanical engineering, and then moving forward into my graduate studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I focused on systems engineering. And so basically, that focus on systems engineering is what's really led me to where I am today, you know, supporting the Mars architecture team doing entry, descent and landing lead. So basically, taking a step back from the mechanical engineering roots that I started with, and really focusing on that big picture: you know, landing on Mars obviously takes a lot of different things happening in concert all at once to get the job done. And so, having the systems engineering background, to be able to take a step back and really look at all the components that are playing into this, just really, that background helped me get to where I am today, but also, I just have found this really strong love of, you know, looking at the really big picture instead of the nitty gritty detail. And so that's a little bit of how I got to where I am right now.  Host: Terrific. Now, you know, most aspects of human spaceflight come with various elements of risk, when we're trying to do something that the human body is not built to do naturally on its own. Alicia, you've got experience landing a vehicle on Mars, so you're conversant with some of those risks. But I wonder, what risks are there that, you know, robotic mission are things that you can accept that you would not accept for landing a vehicle that has human beings onboard?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Yeah, it's a very challenging problem. They are, they're not the same. And I'm really now, just now starting to appreciate the differences for what it takes to accommodate crew onboard. But really, I want to break this down a little bit because…  Host: OK.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: …you know, we have the difference between landing robotic and human missions, but there's really understanding the way that we, we've landed the robotic missions, and so far, or for the past two decades, NASA has sent really two classes of missions to, robotic missions to Mars. Lander missions. And there's the 300-kilogram landers, which is kind of Mars Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity, Phoenix, and Insight. And then there's the Curiosity rover and the 2020 Perseverance rover, that are both about 900 kilograms. So, that's a three times increase in mass. And we had to change a lot of technologies just to get, you know, just to deliver, you know, that three times more massive vehicle.  Host: More so than just tripling up whatever you had done?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right. It doesn't, it doesn't just scale…  Host: OK.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: …the way you would expect it to. So, through the analysis we determined that we couldn't use the technologies like the airbags or the small retrorockets that Spirit and Opportunity used, we needed a bigger heat shield that entry, to protect it during entry. In fact we had, we built the biggest one we could fit into the buildings, right? We had this limitation. But you know, now that we're talking about sending humans to Mars, we, we have to completely rethink those technologies. The, the parachutes aren't big enough to deliver the large masses that we need. So, just going from the 300 kilograms up to the 900 required us to change quite a few elements in our technologies. And then thinking about, you know, what it's going to take to deliver humans and, you know, now we're talking maybe 20 metric tons of, of payload.  We, we can’t…  Host: Wow.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: …right, even the things that we wanted, that we designed and upgraded for the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, you know, now we can't use the parachutes, we can't use the retro rockets, we need something different. And so we're looking at what it would take to do that. And it's a whole bunch of different technologies, like, inflatable structures and, but they still have to fit into launch vehicles. So now, when you add crew we can't have things like I mentioned, the parachutes: when it deploys it results at a very high g load on the vehicle, so like up to nine or 10 gs, which crew doesn't want to have to experience. So, we're looking at ways to redesign the entry guidances, and entry vehicle path through the atmosphere to reduce those gs to something that the crew can survive, plus it's also a little bit much, much more comfortable ride on the way in. So, it's those kinds of things that we have to take into account, especially when you have crew on, crew onboard.  Host: I didn't realize that the difference would be quite so big: you went from like 900 kilograms to 20-metric tons. But in both cases you're trying to land a payload safely, it's just that one of them has living people onboard, the other one it has a robotic payload. Is, is there a, a significant kind of difference in how you work out those risks or is it a completely different set of calculation?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Well, one of the other primary differences is that with all the robotic missions that we've tried to land, they, several of them have been ballistic. So, which means, you know, we don't control them on entry. And so we land where you land and that usually requires very large, flat rock-free areas, so hundreds of kilometers in diameter. And so we don't get to pick exactly where it lands.  For Curiosity we, and then for Perseverance, we will be able to, or we were able to steer it.  Much, the first time we had a guided entry for those vehicles. And we were able to reduce that hundred-kilometer diameter footprint on the surface, you know, where we, it could have landed down to about ten kilometers in diameter. So the difference for when we add crew onboard is that now the crew isn't going to want to walk very far to get their stuff, and what the architecture setup is that we deliver all of the vehicle, all the crew logistics, their supplies and their ascent vehicle and everything, before they ever get there. So, they know it's safe on the, on the surface.  Host: So, now you have a, you have a matter of trying to target the landing of your human crew close to their supplies, which you've sent on ahead.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right, exactly. And they don't want to walk very far to get there. So now instead of landing in ellipses where we think, you know, we can get there within ten kilometers in diameter, we're now talking about landing in something that's one kilometer in diameter. And even the way that the technologies that allow us to do that, we're actually still developing. They're the precision landing sensors, where you have to put them, when they have to turn on so that we can actually see, you know, where you're trying to go and where you're targeting on the surface.  Host: Now, I understand that the actual spacecraft that's going to land people on Mars has not yet been designed. Doug, is it possible to give me a sense of how big or how heavy you think that vehicle is going to be? Or compare to what's already been landed on Mars?  Doug Trent: Yeah, absolutely. So, I noticed that a lot of what you were saying before, you know, you were shocked a little bit about how much mass that we're saying it might cost. And a lot of that comes from the fact that humans tend to be pretty needy payloads, there's a lot of stuff that they need to be able to survive in the environment base on Mars. Things like life support systems, you need water to drink, you need food to eat.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: You need someplace to live and sleep and work out of, and so all these things come together to really increase the amount of mass that we really got to deliver to Mars compared to what we would need for a robot which, you know, typically doesn't need those things.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: So, Alicia kind of alluded at it. Previous payloads landed on Mars, you know, we've had a couple hundred kilograms with a lot of our rovers. And recently we've been, you know, putting down rovers that are upwards of one metric ton. But basically, a lot of our current study suggests that human class landers are going to require a capability to land roughly 20 times that, so on the order of 20, 25 metric tons per lander, onto the lunar surface. And…  Host: So, it’s…  Doug Trent: …these missions actually are going to, I was going to, well…  Host: What I was going to say, is that a similar number for the first vehicle that's coming delivering supplies as well as the one that's got the actual people in it?  Doug Trent: That's correct.  Host: OK.  Doug Trent: So, each Mars mission, right now that we look at, we're typically looking at around three 20-ton landers to do the mission. So, you'd have two landers delivering cargo before you land the third one with crew, and even that third crew lander is going to have some additional cargo on it.  Host: Right, right.  Doug Trent: So typically, when we're looking at these three-lander architectures, the first one is going to land things like maybe your surface power systems, potentially some additional propellant for your ascent vehicle, that will actually take the crew off the surface. And then the second lander is, right now, typically designated for that actual ascent vehicle, because, you know, typically, we like to bring our humans back home after a mission.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: And so, we have a full lander, typically dedicated to that vehicle that does that process to get them back off the surface of Mars. And then finally, the third one, once we've got everything in place, all the cargo, the landers, we've got, you know, our ascent vehicle, we've got a check out from it from Mars, it says it's ready to go, it can come off the surface with the crew, then we'll send our crew out and actually land them on the surface of Mars with, again, another one of those 20-tons landers.  Host: Does the increased size or maybe the shape of the vehicle or something, does that make a difference in how, in the degree of difficulty it is to, to land it softly, if we can say it that way?  Doug Trent: It does. So again, like Alicia was saying, you know, some of the previous technologies that were used for landing some of those robotic rovers, like, airbags were basically, you know, they just go on a ballistic trajectory, they kind of bounce around and roll around on the surface and they land where they land, not terribly precise.  If we're going to be landing multiple landers in a small area so that they don't have to walk terribly far to get it, obviously that takes some different technology as well.  As, like she said, the parachutes tend to induce some pretty significant loads on the vehicles during decent, those are so high that we really can't subject astronauts to those levels, and so we've got to come up with new technologies and new methods to basically land these kinds of payloads on Mars to support that. So currently the designs that we use, what we're looking at is basically employing two key technologies to really help us scale these landers up to this new delivery mass that we need. So, the first technology that we employ is a Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator, HIAD for short is typically what we call it. And basically what it is, is it allows us to get a much larger diameter to do our initial entry deceleration in the launch vehicle constraints that we have. So basically, you know, we're fixed on diameter based on the launch vehicle that we fly on, maybe, in some cases, it might be an 8.4-meter SLS (Space Launch System) fairing…  Host: But you're talking about the diameter of the vehicle itself, the part of it that is going to be leading the way through the atmosphere?  Doug Trent: Correct. But actually, what we'll do is we'll inflate large toroidal type sections of the vehicle that kind of come out and deploy to get a vehicle diameter that's much larger than the primary structure of the vehicle, upwards of 16 meters. And so that's going to give us the surface area, basically, to slow down initially when we start impacting the atmosphere, and that'll help slow it down not as fast, so we don't induce those huge loads that we would see via a traditional parachute.  Host: You mean you're going to ease on the brake? You mean you're going to ease on the brake…  Doug Trent: Right, exactly.  Host: …instead of slamming it.  Doug Trent: Ease on the brake. Got to be nice to our human payload.  Host: Right, OK.  Doug Trent: The second component, obviously is going to be, we don't want to rely on just an inflatable airbag approach where we bounce on the surface and roll around because it's just not going to be a very conducive way of landing sensitive payloads but also humans. And so, the second component is basically a supersonic retro propulsion technology. And basically what that's going to do is once we've extracted as much energy as we can by using the thin atmosphere that does exist on Mars to slow the vehicle down, we're going to have to do a little bit more to make sure that we get that soft touchdown, similar to like what we had in the Apollo days with a, you know, a soft touchdown in the lunar lander on the lunar surface.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: And so basically, what we have is this supersonic retro propulsion component of the landing system that will basically perform the last little bit of propulsive work to basically get that very soft touchdown on the surface.  Host: Neat. Alicia, are there other technologies that, that you guys are trying to incorporate into this that you didn't have for the robotic landers?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Absolutely.  In order to meet our precision landing constraints, you know, so that the crew doesn't have to walk so far -- we can deliver them without, you know, running into any other pre-deployed assets…  Host: Right.   Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: …what we will use are a whole bunch of sensors, and right now we're studying whether we can keep those sensors onboard the entry vehicle or if we need to preplace beacons on the surface or in orbit. But essentially, what these sensors will do is tell us where we're at and how fast we're going as we're flying in, into the landing site. So, we have what we call terrain relative navigation sensors, which are cameras that we take images of the surface as we're coming in and compare those to onboard surface, onboard maps of the terrain to, to tell us exactly where we are and how fast we're going. We also have, as we approach the landing site, we have a navigational Doppler lidar, which will tell us, again, our velocity and altitude and how, our range, how far away we are from the site. And then, as we get really close we, we're anticipating and right now advancing technologies so that we can have a, a lidar that will take an image of the surface right where we want to land and tell us where the rocks and the hazards are so that we can basically avoid them with the hazard detection sensor. And while none of these have flown on any of our vehicles yet, this, Perseverance will be the first mission to, to demonstrate using the terrain relative nav[igation] system.  Host: Cool.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: So yeah, we're testing these things now, so that we can expand on them and help for future, help the future missions.  Doug Trent: I obviously am closely tied in with the Human Landing System that NASA is currently working as well, and so our HLS partners are currently developing lunar lander systems as part of the Artemis program to land humans back on the Moon. Now, obviously, we like to try and invest in technologies that can be applicable in other places, and this is definitely these landing sensors and these precision landing systems is something that, you know, if we're going to build up a sustainable lunar presence, being able to land multiple payloads, again, in a very tight area together, so that they don't have to walk far to go get their payloads on the lunar surface, that kind of technology is very directly applicable to here on Mars. And so we actually have a lot of commercial partners currently developing lunar landers that are going to employ these kinds of technologies that will be directly applicable to, you know, future Mars missions too. So, it's definitely a great partnership that we have with commercial industry. It's something that not just NASA is doing all on our own, we definitely have support from you know, companies like SpaceX, you got Blue Origin, Dynetics all developing landers right now under the Human Landing System program to help further these technologies along with us.  Host: And it only makes sense to make the best use of all the knowledge that you have.  Doug Trent: Absolutely.  Host: The one thing, in the things that you've described, there was one thing I was kind of listening for, and I didn't hear, how do you – and especially with the human landers, and you've talked about the reasons why you want to land it fairly close to all the supplies that have been sent ahead, but -- so, how do you steer that thing in order to get to that smaller target area? If you've got a large enough ship to be carrying the human crew of, we don't know how many yet, plus whatever supplies you're bringing along, moving at that kind of speed, how do you, do you steer it to head it toward the site you've identified?  Doug Trent: Right, so it's definitely a lot of planning ahead of time, before we go and actually initiate any kind of descent. Obviously, there's always going to be a little bit of uncertainty in terms of how exactly do my engines fire, do they fire for the exact amount of time that I, you know, have commanded to do so? And so those are going to introduce some errors. But you know, making sure that, you know, we have technologies and, and components in place that can basically execute the command as we tell them to do so, so that we get nearly as close to what we predict. Now, obviously, like I said, there's variations and so we do have secondary, basically reaction control systems; it's basically a second propulsion system on the vehicle that basically will provide control of the vehicle during these key descent maneuvers. So both during the aerodynamic deceleration, but also during the final retro propulsion. The second propulsion system helps orient the vehicle as it's doing these maneuvers to make sure that we stay on track as we go in for our final descent and landing. And all of this is getting informed and happening in concert with these precision landing technologies, all of the, the optical observations that you know, cameras are taking pictures of, we've got maps of Mars that are pre-loaded onto the vehicle so that what it's seeing and what it expects to see it can try and line those up. And all this is happening in concert to make sure that we get those very precise landings that we need to really execute these missions.  Host: And so, it seems, sounds to me, like the biggest part of that steering is to be aimed properly when you launch, at the right place and at the right time.  Doug Trent: Absolutely.  Host: There have been 10 -- if I've got that right – there’ve been 10 successful landings of payloads on Mars from Earth…I don't know how many from other planets, but eight by the United States, two by the Soviet Union back in the ‘70s. Alicia, how valuable is the data from those uncrewed robotic missions, how, of successfully landing on Mars, how valuable is that data in helping you develop the current EDL plans?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: It's very important: what it's helped us do is provided 10 trajectories, paths through the atmosphere that tells us what the atmosphere is like at each of the different altitudes that we passed through. Now, granted, those are for a specific time, season, location, so they, they're a very limited data set. But for, in some regions of the atmosphere it's all the data that we have. What makes them even more valuable is that missions like Opportunity and Spirit and Curiosity, they've been on the surface at a location where we know exactly where they're at, for years. And most, the rovers that are there all carry a science package that allows them to measure the density, temperature and pressures at the surface. And that really informs our, some of our atmosphere models so that we can, the orbiting spacecraft will be able to correlate data with that. It provides, so there's two spacecrafts right now, Mars Odyssey and [Mars] Reconnaissance Orbiter, two U.S. spacecraft, and then there's the Mars Express, the European one, that are taking data of the upper atmosphere all the time.  Host: OK.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: And so that we can correlate some of that data to the, with the surface measurements, and then it can inform our, our model development and our, that we use for the design of the future missions. So, there's some regions of the atmosphere where we just don't have any, any data, and that's, you know, we, we use that to inform future mission planning as well as future mission design. What, what kinds of missions could we send, whether it's flying ones -- so there's a helicopter that's going to be flying on Mars 2020 -- that'll give us a new opportunity to look at different atmosphere in different regions that we haven't been able to at this point.  Host: And you're talking about meteorological conditions. The one that I know anything about is dust storms, we hear about dust storms on Mars a lot. What kind of challenge do you face if it's time to land on Mars and there's a big dust storm going on?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Well, until recently, we said we won't land if we're in orbit. [Laughter]  Host: We'll wait. [Laughter]  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We'll try to wait it out, right? And so, for most of the year it is not global dust storm season and so that would be a reasonable assumption to make. There are times when you do get those, those global storms that do take months to decay. But what we, what we've planned for so far is that you could stay in orbit and wait. The problem is, really, it creates a level of uncertainty that we just haven't been able to, to understand and measure, because just the atmosphere on a, on a clear day is, it has uncertainty in it and variability that we have to plan for. Adding in the additional complexity of a dust storm, which essentially what it does is it, it, it heats up the atmosphere so that all the density is at the higher altitudes, and there's lower density near the surface. So, it just makes, you know, most of our models aren't set up to, to capture the full variability that that could entail, we don't have a lot of measurements during that. So, it's really just as an uncertainty in the mission design and planning that we would like to avoid. The other challenge is that, and some of the global storms where you just can't see the surface, it does make using those precision landing sensors a challenge. So, there are lots of things that we would like to avoid with that. The other challenge is that with our capability in our data that we have so far, we can, we can forecast weather on the surface of Mars for about a day; that's about how good we can predict ahead. So, it would be OK if we were in a, say, a one sol, one day of Mars orbit around it, and only took 11 hours to get once we deorbit from that, from that to get to the surface it would take 11 hours, we think we'd have a pretty good estimate of what the weather at the surface would be; where if we decided to be in a larger orbit, say a five sol or an orbit that takes five Mars days to go around, it would take a two and a half day, days to, to get from, you know, once you deorbit that to the surface it would take two and a half days. Well, since we can't predict out that far, that also adds an additional uncertainty.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We're trying to identify what, what information we would need to improve those prediction models so that, you know, would enable that kind of prediction capability for those types of missions. But right now, we would like to say, we'd like to avoid landing in a dust storm. But if we had to, then we'd have to add additional robustness to the system in the way of extra propellant, or, you know, we'd have to, we'd have to…  Host: To be able to wait.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right.  Host: Yeah. One important part, got to be an important part of the consideration for this, has to be the location on the surface, like where on Mars do we want to land? Doug, can, can you give me an idea of what are the characteristics of a good landing site, or a perfect landing site?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so choosing a landing site is actually quite complex of a task. There's a lot of factors that go into play. For the robotic landers, the previous Mars missions, there's really always been a very clear science objective that's been defined in partnership with, you know, lots of NASA scientists. However, when landing humans on Mars, there's some other considerations that come into play. Obviously, we want to do science and things like that, but one of the largest things that has to be defined is, you know, what are we going to do when we get there? Are we going there because we want to do human exploration? And so, in that case, we might be landing in one spot, want to do some scientific exploration in that area and then land in a completely different area on the planet to do science exploration somewhere else. That's one way. Another one might be, if I'm hoping to develop a longer-term human presence, maybe a Mars colony perhaps, the latter, so that Mars colony is going to require a site rich in raw resources which can be refined to use and utilized for further developing the colony. So, things like ice, so that we have water to develop, and we can convert that into air to breathe.  You might need, you know, a site rich in specific minerals and things like that, that I can refine into resources to actually build structures and things like that. So outside of these questions, obviously, there's also the performance related part of it. So, in terms of selecting the landing site, not all landing sites are the same in terms of how they impact the, the design of our vehicle. So, things like surface condition, how soft or how hard is the surface that we're going to be physically landing on? How many rocks and boulders are there, and how far are they dispersed or how close are they together in the potential landing zone? What's the slope, the elevation of the local terrain? Is it, you know, perfectly flat or maybe is it kind of like a little foothill that we're landing near or maybe even on? All these play a role in the design of the actual lander itself. However, basically, landing is not the only component. So obviously, we're here talking about how we, how do we stick the landing, but unfortunately, taking it back on a more systems perspective, landing isn't the only component. So obviously, with our crew, like I said earlier, we want to bring them home. And so ascent is another portion of the mission, very important part of the mission to get our crew home. And unfortunately, the landing site selection and how that impacts the ascent vehicle might not be the same as how it impacts the descent system. And so, you know, for instance, in terms of the landing vehicle, I would prefer the land, the landing system at as low altitude as possible. And that's mainly because I'll get a more dense atmosphere, it allows me to slow down better and so I can have less propellant, basically. However, the ascent system would prefer to land on top of the highest mountain possible, because that just puts me that much closer to orbit, which then it requires less propellant. So really…  Host: But then you'd have to walk down the mountain, right? You have to walk up the mountain to get to it.  Doug Trent: Yeah, absolutely. And so, it's just basically highlighting the fact that there's this trade amongst the various different components so that the lander isn't the only component in a Mars mission, there's a lot of other things that go into place. And so, for me, an ideal landing spot would be something that's flat, has a nice hard surface, so I don't have to worry about my landing gear sinking into like a really dusty surface or something like that.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: Large enough that I can land several vehicles in close proximity. So, like you said, top of a mountain, probably not a good idea. And really only a small amount of smaller rocks, so I don't have to worry about maybe a landing gear, you know, hitting a large boulder or something like that, or maybe a larger rock that puts me in a weird tilt when I land or something like that would be not ideal. And lastly, I'd like it to be close to at least some useful resources, particularly something like water ice, that can be useful for, you know, life support, drinking and things like that.  Host: Particularly if it's an early mission, where you're going to have to be setting things up from scratch.  Doug Trent: Right.  Host: You don't want to have to go far to, to get them.  Doug Trent: That's, that's true.  Host: I, I, I can understand as you say it that there are so many different things to, to take into account that it's, where you want to land is not a simple answer. And, and one of the big parts of it, as you noted, is that it depends on what you want to do there. So, that's all part of the stuff that you guys have still got work to do to figure out in the years to come. One thing we didn't talk about, that I want to now, as we've considered all these elements and kind of try to synthesize it, is to flesh out the human detail for me. If we all three were strapped into the Mars vehicle and headed down for the surface, Doug, can you give me a sense of what it would look like, and sound like and feel like as we rode through the Martian atmosphere to the surface?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so unfortunately, I have not had the chance to fly on a space shuttle or maybe land on the Moon.  Host: Yeah; not yet.  Doug Trent: Yeah, not yet, maybe someday. So, it is a little bit challenging to say how it might look and sound inside the vehicle. But we can definitely make some educated assumptions or guesses on how that might look. So obviously, the design of the crew cabin is going to have a huge impact on what it physically looks like and sounds like. You know, the materials that it's made of, how big it is, all these things are going to play a role in how that might happen. However, with the design of the current entry, descent, and landing system, there is a bit that we do know that it's going to be similar to. Based on the design that we have right now, it's going to be very similar to both a shuttle landing and a lunar landing; you kind of get components of both. So, this is because, you know, like I said, the initial parts were definitely entering an atmosphere, going very, very fast, and so you've got that component very similar to a shuttle how it reenters the Earth's atmosphere -- obviously, it's going hypersonic and so you're going to get plasma buildup and things like this. So, any kind of windows that you might have, you're going to see just fireballs out the windows…  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: …similar to any kind of re-entry during Earth. So, we would expect to see similar kinds of events while landing on Mars, and, of course, the sounds that would accompany those kinds of things. However, unlike a shuttle re-entry and landing, the shuttle lands, basically, it glides down back to the surface and lands on a runway. However, like we were talking about, again, we're going to have a hypersonic retro propulsion, supersonic retro propulsion system, where we have to basically turn on engines to do the final little bit of landing. So that's where basically the more like a lunar landing component comes in. So obviously we're going to have the sounds of you know, pumps spooling up to start moving propellant, you're going to have engines igniting, all the good sounds that comes with a loud, powerful, rocket engine igniting and so, you'll have that component as well that's maybe a little bit different than the shuttle system. Now, the crew is going to experience acceleration similar to those experienced by the shuttle astronauts. And that's not just random, that's by design. We obviously have a very good understanding of the limitations of the human body under accelerations and have designed the lander and the descent profile to basically provide that environment such that it's not too extreme for the astronauts. However, we are still working with our medical community on the finer details. So, things such as seating orientation: you know, are they going to be sitting upright like we sit in a chair here on Earth, or is it going to be, or is it going to be more of an inclined position to better accommodate the acceleration load? So, for instance, you know, we might lean them back at some kind of angle to put their back towards the vehicle so that we have a good, large surface on their body to impart some potentially higher loads. So, things like this we haven't really nailed down yet and it's still under study, but we're obviously working with the various communities necessary to kind of flesh these details out.  Host: One of the things that it occurs to me you'll also, when working with the medical community, you got to consider the fact that these astronauts who are about to land have been in a weightless environment for, for many, many months now, and they may be a lot weaker than, than they were when they launched.  Doug Trent: Yeah, that's absolutely correct. I mean, right now, the, the missions that we're looking at, they could take months, basically, to get the astronauts to Mars. And, you know, we've seen from astronauts coming back from the space station all the time, you know, they'll land wherever they land and typically we have a whole host, a whole crew of people from Earth to help them out of the vehicle and move them to, you know, whatever transport vehicle to move on after they've landed. That's something we're not going to have on Mars. And so, that deconditioned state of the astronauts when they get to Mars is certainly a very large concern that we have. Ideally, they'll be able to get out of their chairs; the size of these landers and how tall they are, they're likely going to have to probably crawl down a ladder or something of that sort to be able to get to other assets that might be on the surface, like a rover or other payloads or things like this. So, a lot of it right now, the approach is, well, when they land on the surface we'll give them a certain amount of period, maybe it's a few days or a week or so, to basically condition to that new environment, basically the Mars gravity, to hopefully give their bodies enough time to at least kind of get their walking legs back underneath them to basically execute the mission.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: But that's a good point. So, what, so that means that the, whatever they land in has to have everything that they need to live for that amount of time.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: And we've talked about being able to maybe just deliver the crew in something like an Orion capsule, or you know, something, a smaller vehicle, and then have them get out, but because of this deconditioned crew environment that they will be in, we do need to have them land in something that's got all the things that they will need to live for that long before transferring.  Host: Right. Alicia, you've, you’ve already landed robotics on, on Mars before; have you thought what it'd be like the first time you can land something that's got human beings inside of it?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You know, back when the movie “The Martian” came out, they had all these different ideas of how to, you know, as we're designing these and we're looking at, you know, how can we use our imaginations to figure out how all the different parts could be interchangeable, or if something did go wrong how would you, you know, address that. You know, so it's, you know, getting out and looking for the first time at this new planet that we haven't ever, you know, looked at with our with human eyes -- we've done it with robotic eyes a lot of times -- and try to just imagine what that would be like, I think it comes back to the engineers on also imagining, you know, what could go wrong with the systems that we're building and how we could, you know, make sure that, they're robust to a wider range, because we just don't know what it's going to be like. So that's, that's part of the challenge and it's also part of the fun.  Host: Yeah, to be able to figure out how to do something that people have been thinking about doing for generations; it's got to be a really cool job to have. Alicia and Doug, this has been terrific to hear your perspective on this. Thank you, very much, and good luck with the work.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You're welcome.  Doug Trent: Thank you.

            "description": "Gary Jordan Host: Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 117, “Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer: The Science.” I'm Gary Jordan, I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what’s going on in the world of human spaceflight. Coming up very soon, this November, 2019, astronauts aboard the International Space Station are set to kick off a unique and difficult set of spacewalks to repair an experiment called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Sounds a lot like something straight out of a sci-fi, right? But it's very real and a very complicated piece of equipment. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, or AMS, is looking at high energy particles and looking for evidence of antimatter and dark matter in the cosmos, which may reveal more about the formation of the universe. No big deal. Now with such a complicated particle physics experiment, comes some complicated spacewalks, very much on par with the Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions. We’ll have to do a podcast on that sometime. So to help bring to light the significance of this experiment and these spacewalks, we are going to dive deep into the story of the AMS and this repair, and break it into three parts -- the science, the spacewalks and the tools -- all with fascinating discussions with the experts that are working on repairing and upgrading the AMS. So today for part one of this three-part series, we are discussing the science of the AMS focusing on cosmology and astrophysics with Brandon Reddell. Reddell is an assistant program scientist in the International Space Station program, here, at the Johnson Space Center. He has a Ph.D. in physics specializing in high energy space physics. Most of his graduate work was focused on modeling high energy collisions, produced in accelerators on Earth, and at NASA, he spent over ten years testing and modeling spacecraft hardware and the human body for radiation effects. Here he also collaborates with one of the primary authors of the Galactic Cosmic Ray Model that NASA uses to predict astronaut health risks. As well as hardware reliability to improve model predictions for these deep space missions. The AMS is one such instrument providing data on cosmic ray species that are of interest in improving these NASA models. So let's get right into it. Astrophysics and Cosmology 101 and the science of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer with Dr. Brandon Reddell. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Brandon, thank you so much for coming on the Podcast today.  Brandon Redell: Well, thank you. It's a pleasure to be here and I'm looking forward to it.  Host: I am both excited and very nervous to talk about this today because we had talked a lot about human space flight, which is part of this story because it is an experiment on the space station, there's going to be some spacewalks to actually go fix it. But now we're getting into cosmology, we're getting to astrophysics, so I'm going to do my very best to try to ask very appropriate and relevant questions for you.  Brandon Redell: No, that's great. It's a very complex experiment and it covers a lot of fields, so I'll do my best to try to answer everything.  Host: Well, let's go right into it. I wanted to start by, kind of, setting the background of what it is exactly that the AMS is exploring, by giving kind of a 101. So let's go into cosmology and astrophysics. Tell us about the universe, Brandon.  Brandon Redell: Okay. Well, first of all, we know the universe is very big but we also know that it had a beginning, right? That's been pretty well confirmed, really in the last century. Edwin Hubble, you may have heard of, first measured redshift is which is sort of a measure of how everything's leaving, spreading away from us, right? At some velocity. So there's been a whole slew of other satellite measurements like of the cosmic microwave background and things like that that have confirmed this. There's no doubt that we know that it's expanding and if you just take one over the expansion rate you can sort of derive how old the universe is, and so we know we're about 14 billion years old. Now so the expansion rate is still under investigation, there's some variations in the numbers, but they're all indicating 13, 14 billion years old, something like that. And so what we do know too is we have a lot of theories, like from general relatively and things like that, that also point that there was an ultimate beginning that also fit the model and predict what the future of distribution of galaxies look like, you know, how the universe is spatially organized and things like that, and in the right elements that are in the universe. So we have really good models that help support that. And so we feel like we have a pretty good view of the universe.  Host: And that view, the thing you're talking about right now, is the big-bang theory?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, it's the big-bang theory, that's sort of the generic term, but there's actually several different models and we can talk about that now or later but--     Host: Let's go right into it, yeah.  Brandon Redell: So one of the big models is called the \"Lambda CDM Model,\" [Cold Dark Matter]. So Lambda is just a Greek letter, looks like an upside-down triangle, kind of, like an upside-down V basically. And it's really the value that refers to dark energy, OK? So the C D M part of Lambda, the CDM, is cold dark matter. So really this model is purely a mathematical model that's a fit to only using only six parameters that basically described the overall evolution of the universe today. And so what we use is there's something called the \"Baryon Density\" and we can talk about baryon's here in a little bit. These are all inputs, baryon density, dark matter density, the age of the universe, and there's a couple of other parameters, they're pretty complex. But with only just six parameters we can actually from right after The Big Bang, using the current laws of physics, this model will run and it'll predict basically the existence and the structure of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which we measure all the time. It also predicts the large scale of the universe. The distribution of galaxies, the abundance's of hydrogen and helium, which are the abundant elements in the universe and so forth. So we have a -- it matches a lot of what we observe, so it's probably the most successful model, but there are some shortcomings and there's some competitors, but that's predominately the major model used today. And it's sometimes it's often referred to as the \"Standard Model of Cosmology.\"  Host: Yeah. So basically what you're doing is you're looking at the universe and you're saying, here's all the things that exist, this cosmic microwave background, right? Something's that's -- it's like, what is it three, four, Kelvin?  Brandon Redell: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the current temperature.  Host: Yeah, it's just so it's fizzling in the background. So we're like, what made this, what made the galaxies the way they were and you -- this particular big-bang theory is a way of modeling that mathematically.  Brandon Redell: Right. And that's just one thing that it models, right? It successfully models, like, what's really important is the abundance of elements that were created initially in the Big Bang because once that's said, that determines how much mass you have in the universe and how much stars and galaxies you have, and so forth. So that's really an important feature as well.  Host: See, that's one thing that’s really it's fascinating to the point where I don't think anyone can really fully comprehend just, you know, when you're talking about stuff in the universe.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: How much stuff there is. You know, we're looking at our galaxy and we're like, wow, that is huge.  Brandon Redell: Right.  Host: That's full of billions of stars. And now we're figuring out that a lot of these stars, or maybe most of them, have planets. So it's just becoming so big just in one galaxy and then you find out, yeah, there's a few more galaxies.  Brandon Redell: Well, there's that, right? So the current estimates are there's billions of galaxies.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: There's been some research done in the last year that if you look at smaller galaxies that are called \"dwarf galaxies\" so like the Milky Way Galaxy has several dwarf galaxies, like, we have the large and small Magellanic Clouds, but outside of that, they're so small that we can't even see. So most galaxies have maybe hundreds to thousands dwarf galaxies. So when you factor all that in, some of the estimates in this recent research estimate trillions of galaxies.  Host: Oh, see, now, don't do that to me. [laughter]  Brandon Redell: They're big numbers but not all galaxies are as life, as we know it, might not be suitable for life because there's a lot of instability and irregular and elliptical galaxies, and things like that. But nevertheless, there's a large amount of material. And one thing that's kind of interesting is when you actually look at all the galaxies and stars, when you talk about the total content of the universe, matter and energy, that's only about 5% of what we really see out there. So the rest of it is unknown, so we only know a lot about a small amount, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: When you look at just as mass alone, the amount of stars and galaxies is approximately 15% of the universe, by mass. And this mysterious material of dark matter is another part of it for mass.  Host: It has to do with the way that you're modeling the predictions of the universe, right? So there's -- if you just do the calculations based on what you observe mass wise, it just -- it doesn't work out, there's this other thing that's helping out with the formation of the universe.  Brandon Redell: In a sense you could say that.  Host: OK.  Brandon Redell: Now, we know observationally, and we have indirect evidence of dark matter. I mean, we can look at the galaxies, the rotation curves. In fact, that's sort of how it was first determined, was that there had to be a lot more mass around galaxies to account for the rotation of stars around the out on the spiral arms and things like that. We also know the universe is expanding and that's related to this dark energy term. So these are all parameters that we can measure. Going back to this Lambda CDM model, those are all predicted based on these initial six inputs, and so we can compare that with what we measure as long as, you know, we know the model's predicting everything we see we have good reasons to believe that what that model predicts for these values are indeed close to what they are in reality.  Host: So what does that say about what we know about the formation of the universe? Like, what questions I guess what I'm leading to, is what questions do we have even with this model that we still need to answer?  Brandon Redell: Well, so – yeah, that's a great question. And so, again, this model sort of picks up at some small amount of time after the Big Bang, right? So we don't know obviously what was before the Big Bang, right? The current understanding when you look at the space time theorems that there was nothing, right? So that's really hard to comprehend.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Brandon Redell: That actually gets into the metaphysics and things like that. But once we have something started, there's a lot of uncertainty of what initially happened in that first ten to the minus 38th seconds or something like that, right? So one of the current theories is called \"Inflation\" so for approximately a ten to the minus thirty six seconds or so, the universe expanded twenty orders of magnitude. We don't know how to model that, but we do have some evidence that that actually occurred. So that part of the model has not been sorted out as far as modeling that Initial Inflationary epoch of time, so that needs to be incorporated. And then on top of that, you might have heard of this term called \"Quantum Gravity\" we don't know how gravity works at the quantum level. And so our understanding of physics and recombining all these forces back at that earlier time, that's sort of a -- that's current modern research in particle physics and its astrophysics, cosmology, it sort of all blended together at that point. But there's a lot of understanding of the physics going on at the smallest times scales right at the beginning of the universe.  Host: So naturally, and this can sort of lead into our discussion about AMS, is based on these models of how we think the universe is created and what we would like to understand, what are things that we can look for that would provide the evidence?  Brandon Redell: Right. And so -- yeah, that's exactly right. AMS is looking for antimatter and I can talk about that here in a second.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: Dark matter and just cosmic rays in general. One of the big questions is -- and this is perplexed astrophysicists, cosmologists for decades now is when we look out at everything, why is there only matter and no antimatter? Because these initial models, like Lambda CDM, they actually predict we should have a 50/50 mix of antimatter and matter. Antimatter is simply it's the same thing as matter but it has the opposite charge, if you think of a proton as a plus charge to it, an antiproton is the same mass but it has a negative charge and it also has some different quantum numbers that kind of determine the spin and angular momentum and things like that. But effectively, it's the same particles with negative charge. And so AMS is looking at signs from antimatter to try to understand, is there any original antimatter out there from the creation of the universe or maybe is it there's some theories that talk about dark matter either decaying or annihilating each other that could produce antimatter. So that's sort of why it's designed and located in space, is to make these measurements to try the help sort that out. And at the same time a lot of these things, as they travel from distant parts of our universe, our galaxy, to Earth, they become high energy and they're just high energy particles moving and we call those cosmic rays. And so those have direct application in bearing on success for human space flight as well.   Host: OK. So I want to go through. So you talked about what it's looking for, you said antimatter is one of them because there should be antimatter, so where is it? The other part was did you say dark matter? Was it what it's looking for?  Brandon Redell: Yes, dark matter.  Host: So how do you -- what's going on there? How could we look for that?  Brandon Redell: OK. So for dark matter?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: OK. So dark matter, so we know observationally, like we mentioned earlier, we definitely know that there's a lot of mass sitting out there around galaxies, for instance, in between a lot of the voids in space. The Lambda CDM model actually predicts 26% of the mass energy content of our universe is dark matter.  Host: Wow.  Brandon Redell: And so that's in conjunction with predicting everything else in the universe. So we know there's probably a significant amount of it, and most importantly, we can actually observe it. Also through gravitational lensing, we know that there's got to be additional mass out there. And that's light bending around other galaxies when we're looking out in the distance.  Host: You're measuring how much light is bending essentially?  Brandon Redell: Well, you're looking at objects behind more massive objects, and so the light kind of gets bend around them and so you might see maybe two images because the light kind of gets split and you're seeing -- it looks like two different angles, but it's really being bent around a large massive objective. And so we know, just looking at the normal matter there, that there's got to be more mass to bend that light because we know general relatively pretty well. In fact, it's probably the most accurate or the most well tested of the physics theories. I think we know it out to an accuracy of 15 or 16 decimal places.  Host: And what's that, general relatively?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, the general -- Einstein's theory of general relatively.  Host: Which says space and time, is that the one or is it something else?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, yeah, yeah it's related it's-- you know, defined by a very complex math but in effect really what it's saying is it's another form of gravity, but it basically tells you that mass warps the space around it and it's that warping of the space that controls how that mass moves in there.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: So it's very interlocked. It'll make you think a little crazy if you think about it too much, but it's very -- mass and gravity are effectively, you know, related.  Host: OK.  Brandon Redell: To that. So dark matter, we're trying to measure that because nobody knows physically what's it consist of, right? We know indirectly it exists, but we don't know what particles it's made of. And so there's some theories out there that don't have any direct scientific evidence, but mathematically, if you extend the standard model of physics, which predicts all the right particles out there, there's various forms of that that lead to prediction of these exotic particles. Things called \"WIMPs, axions\".  Host: Cool.  Brandon Redell: Things like that. A WIMP is a Weekly Interacting Massive Particle that's just an acronym because it's called dark matter, it's dark, it doesn't give off or interact with light. So that it's really hard to see, it's hard to probe it and test for it and so that's why we can't measure it. But the idea is if these -- if this dark matter consisted of these other particles, it can interact with itself and create secondary particles that we know about and maybe can detect. And so that's what we're looking for, detecting these secondary interactions that indicate, you know, some other type of particle that's theorized right now.  Host: OK. Yeah. And this is along the lines of things we can look at to, sort of, help us give that evidence of how the universe forms, we talked about antimatter, we talked about dark matter. The other one you mentioned was cosmic rays?  Brandon Redell: Yeah. Cosmic rays, yes.  Host: So what's that one?  Brandon Redell: So if you think -- so I said the universe was about let's say 14 billion years old, the first generation of stars, they're actually called \"generation three stars\" in galaxies they kind of formed a couple hundred -- when the universe was a couple hundred million years old. From that time forward, there's been generations of stars in galaxies that have gone through these lifecycles and processes. And so for massive stars, one of their end states is they swell up and then they get so big and then gravity pulls them back down when they exhaust their fuel and they explode as a super nova. And so a lot of the cosmic rays, are just -- if you think about the periodic table of elements from hydrogen all the way up to iron, they're just the nuclei, no electrons around them, just the nuclei's zipping through space at relativistic speeds. As they travel, they interact with magnetic fields and they get accelerated. So they're moving very fast, you know, the speed of light and they're all over, they come from every possible direction at random angles and they're floating around the universe everywhere.  Host: Wow. So they're high energy, are they heavier particles too?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like a proton has -- it's just a proton with an electron around it. You go to helium, you have two protons and two neutrons, right? So as you go up the periodic table of elements, all the way up to iron which has 26 protons and 56 nuclei protons and neutrons. So, yeah, the higher you go up in the periodic table, the bigger the nucleolus is and therefore, the more damage they could cause too.  Host: OK. Now, there's something else here that it might be a separate topic or it might be along the lines of stuff that we can look for are \"quarks\" are they intermingled in this in anyway?  Brandon Redell: So quarks, yeah, they're -- they play a role in this.  Host: OK.  Brandon Redell: But they don't exist by themselves. Quarks, they basically the only way we really can see those is through -- like, currently, if you look at, like, particle gliders like at CERN, right? It uses very high energy interactions. So it accelerates, let's say, two protons near the speed of light and collide them and then for a brief amount of time you, sort of, break it up into its parts, and we can talk about that in a minute. But a proton's made up of three different quarks. So for baryonic matter, which is another name for saying all the matter that we see and that you and I are made up of and all the stars and everything, pretty much made up of quarks and there's six different flavors of quarks. But this strong nuclear force sort of binds them together and so it's so strong that you really can't separate them for that long without them recombining or interacting some other way. So they don't exist by themselves, but you can infer things about quarks based on studying these other particles.  Host: I see. So that's where they come in, by studying the other particles?  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: OK. OK. So now, I think we set a nice base for cosmology and astrophysics. We have this idea of how we think the universe formed and we're looking at these things to help us give evidence of that. So now let's go to the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.  Brandon Redell: OK.  Host: What is this thing and how it is helping to answer those questions?  Brandon Redell: OK. So I like to think of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Version 2, which is on space station, as basically a particle physics experiment that you might see at CERN [Center European Research Nuclear, Geneva, Switzerland] somewhere. But instead of being at CERN, it's mounted on the trust of the space station, right? So it's unique in the sense that it is a modern physics particle detector, a very complex one out in space, right? On the space station. And so what it -- and we can talk more about the hardware if you want but it basically has six, seven different type of detector systems to help you measure all the parameters that you need to help sort out these big questions about antimatter, dark matter, and cosmic rays, right? Like as far as measuring the charge of these particles, the masses, and if it's antimatter versus matter.  Host: OK. So it is -- the position in space has a certain benefit to it.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: In terms of finding where these particles come from.  Brandon Redell: Yeah. OK.  So yeah, that's a good point.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So being up on space station where we're above most of the Earth's atmosphere, if we weren't, if we're down on, let's say, on the surface, you have this column of atmosphere above us. And most of the cosmic rays interact with the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere and they break apart, and so you really don't get a direct measurement of the primary cosmic rays. So we're above most of that and so we have a direct path of measuring those primary particles and then we also have the infrastructure on space station with power and data and so forth that helps make it possible.  Host: OK. So you mentioned going into the hardware of AMS, like what --  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: -- is inside of it that actually helps to -- so how's that work?  Brandon Redell: Okay. So basically there's -- AMS, so the A M in the AMS is magnetic, Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. So basically it has this large magnet in the center that's approximately three thousand times the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, so that sounds like a lot.  Host: Wow.  Brandon Redell: But it's over -- let's say, about a meter or so in space, right? Whereas, Earths field's around the planet, right? So it has more bending power. But nevertheless, that's a very powerful magnet to be in space, and so what we do as these charged particles zipping along in space, when they come near a magnetic field, they like to spiral around magnetic field lines. And so the direction they spiral, tells you the charge, right? If it's a positive charge, it'll spiral in one direction, if it's negative, it'll go the other. So the purpose of the magnetic field is just strictly to get particles to bend it a little bit. And so all of the material around that magnet is six or seven different detectors, let's say. So there's silicon trackers that basically measure the trajectory and that's how we can get the curvature so we know which way it's a parameter when you know to help based on the magnetic field strength, to get the charge and the momentum of the particle, which is related to its energy.  Brandon Redell: OK.  Host: There's transition detectors that help distinguish protons and electrons versus really just between protons and electrons. As it comes in, it transverses many layers of materials, you get different X-rays that are created from, let's say, the electrons that don't get generated by protons, so we can distinguish between those two types of particles. There's something called \"Time of Flight Counters\" that use energy lost to basically help understand the charge of the cosmic rays. Also, it helps on timing the events because we need to count the ones that enter in one side and travel out the other side, not coming in through the side of it. So as it trans you know, basically, when it goes through one end of it, it kind of starts it kind of resets all the other detectors. It says okay start counting at this point so it can measure all the right parameters and tie it to the same event. And then there's something called \"Anti coincidence detectors\" to help roll out particles coming in from the side because you don't want to count those if you don't have the full -- having the particle interact with all the detectors where you could set all the full information, you're only going to get a subset of information and that could be erogenous on some of the data analysis. And then there's something called a rich -- it's called, \"RICH\" it stands for the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector. So when particles move faster than the speed of light inside a material, they admit a light cone, it's a well-known, it's called the Cherenkov Effect. And so the size of that cone tells you a lot about the velocity of that particle, so that helps really measure the velocity. And then finally there's a thing called the \"E Cal\" it's an electromagnetic calorimeter and it's just a bunch of material. And so when a proton type particle comes in versus an electron, it has a different type of particle shower. So it can basically distinguish electrons and positrons separately from protons and heavier nuclei, like helium and stuff. So between all these six detectors, we're basically measuring the charge, the mass, the momentum or energy. And so you build up this -- you just collect particles over time to build up statistics so that you can get more accurate answers to understanding, you know, the distribution of particles that are coming in.  Host: So it's more collecting information about what's happening to the particles as they pass through, based on how they react with the magnetic field?  Brandon Redell: Right, right. Exactly.  Host: Yeah. OK.  Brandon Redell: The magnetic field, it's all about the magnetic field.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So and that's related to the AMS EVA's. The magnetic field causes the particle to go through the silicon trackers. And so that's really key to understanding if it's matter versus antimatter because if it curves one way or the other. We need to be able to measure that, and if you can't measure that there's no way -- you can't tell.  Host: Oh.  Brandon Redell: So that's sort of why the reason for the EVA's to repair some equipment on that.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: And we can talk about that in a minute. But ultimately, it's a very complex system, it has a lot of computers in it, a lot of data channels and but it's all about counting particles, counting particles, their energy and their charge, basically, and mass.  Host: Yeah, just a massive collection of data.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Because, like you said, there's particles flying everywhere.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Space happens to be a great place to do it and it's measuring the way they're interacting. That's interesting. I did have a clarification point because this part is just kind of rattling around in my brain, you said when positively charged particles go through the magnetic field they spin one way.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: And when negatively charged, they spin the other way.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Now, what's the difference between antimatter?  Brandon Redell: So, antimatter's, it's the same thing as matter but it has the opposite charge.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So for instance, the positron is the antimatter equivalent of an electron. So electron, as we all learn in high school chemistry, has a negative charge, right? E with a minus sign. Well, positron is the exact same mass, 9.1 times 10 and minus 31 kilograms, but it has a plus charge. So there's this fundamental physics theorem called the \"Lorentz force\" and it has to do with a charged particle moving in the presence of a magnetic field. And so there's a force that causes the beginning of the bend. So a positive charge, when you do the math, it'll tell you, let's say, go clockwise, if it's traveling a certain direction around the magnetic field. The opposite charge, the math, the force bends it the opposite direction and it's strictly because of the minus sign difference.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: It's really I mean, mathematically, it's just the difference of a sign but that's -- it's been verified since Isaac Newton's time, probably, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: Probably not that far back, but they didn't know about electrons and stuff back then. But it's really well known.  Host: So a proton has a positive charge too --  Brandon Redell: Yeah, proton's positive.  Host: -- but it's just basically the way that an electron would interact and the way a proton would interact are different they would just spin opposite because they're antimatter?  Brandon Redell: Yeah. The direction well, OK, a proton is not antimatter, but a positron is.  Host: That's what I'm saying is that, like, the way a proton goes through and it has a positive charge, it spins like a positive charge but it interacts with the magnet because it's a proton, it's not a positron, right?  Brandon Redell: Right.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So all charged particles will spin one way or the other.  Host: Right.  Brandon Redell: So if it's positive, let's say for the sake of the argument, based on the configuration of the magnetic field, like, what directions they're pointing in. All positives will go one direction, all negatives will bend the other way.  Host: Yes.  Brandon Redell: And so whether its so all you know from that is just really is it plus or minus? So you need other instruments to tell you what the mass is. Now, this silicon tracker may whole because you're recording the trajectories it goes through. So a proton's about a thousand times heavier than electrons. So it's harder, it can't, you know, depending on the energy, right? It's going to have a slightly different curvature than that. So there's some information gain from that but that's where these other detectors come in to help you sort that out.  Host: Got it. OK. So that's different. I was thinking positive charge but they're just different so that does make sense.  Brandon Redell: I would like to -- can I go back and say one thing?  Host: Yeah. Please do.  Brandon Redell: So since you were talking about antimatter and matter, so that's one of the outstanding questions in all of the physics. You know, like we said earlier, about it should have been about a 50/50 mix, there's actually some research out there, based on theory, that says shortly after the beginning of the universe, the amount of positive matter was just barely above the count for negative matter. So, like, I think the number's about ten billion, so for every ten billion antimatter particles, there's ten billion in one. So it's just the slightest imbalance. The current theory is that all this matter, antimatter annihilated each other and that's why it's gone. And then you had the small residual positive matter that ultimately led to, you know, having a positive matter dominating the universe. So that's why it's really important to try to understand is there any original antimatter left over because we could have antimatter galaxies or gas clouds out in space or stars made out of antimatter. Theoretically, it's possible, especially if it wasn't all used up or interacted early in the universe, so that's sort of what the AMS is looking for. And it's hard to distinguish between, is it the original antimatter or is it antimatter created because of dark matter interacting with itself? And so that's what it's trying the sort out. It's possible to measure antimatter but where is it coming from? That's big question.  Host: OK. Yeah. This is super complicated.  Brandon Redell: Oh, yeah. There's a lot.  Host: So speaking of complicated, going to how the AMS works, I know you said this was the second iteration that we're going to be working on the space station, there was one I believe to just make sure that this technology works in space.  Brandon Redell: Right.  Host: So that was actually even before space station.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, yeah, that flew on the space shuttle back in--  Host: '98.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, 98.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: And so that was called AMS-01 and it was, you know, so most shuttle missions were pretty short, like less than weeks. I think this one flew for ten or eleven days, I believe. And it was very similar, maybe not quite as complex, but it was sort of a pathfinder to prove out this technology. And in fact, I believe there's been six or seven papers that came out of that work, even though it was active for maybe ten days or so, it collected enough information to make some statistically relevant observations. And it sort of -- one of its primary claims that it made was that a lot of people still quote and we're trying to verify now is sort of an upper limit to this helium, anti-helium ratio. So anti-helium is just another antiparticle, right? So helium, which has two protons, two neutrons but it has a negative charge. So AMS has the ability to distinguish between the two. And so a lot of people think if it can measure so protons are the most abundant elements and then helium's the second most. So the protons interact a lot with other materials. So you have -- let's say more noise, a lot of other things to consider, whereas, the helium's probably a cleaner signal. And so it's really important to try to measure the helium component to get let's say, a more accurate understanding of what the origin of dark matter. So that was an important find and then the AMS-02 detector is designed to try to probe a little bit -- the same number, right? But with more accuracy.  Host: OK. So yeah, let's go into AMS-02. It looked at this helium, anti-helium and then actually proved that that technology works. Now the AMS-02, it's a very complicated piece of equipment and it took a long time to get up there, especially because of several delays too.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Like that's even Columbia I think had it.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, so there was -- yeah, you know, I think there was probably delays even on the ground because it's such a complex experiment.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: It's a typical experiment you might see at CERN. It involves what? Sixty different institutions as of now, that number can change a little bit, but sixteen different countries. So, like I said we had, I think six different detector systems or so. So there's a lot of hardware and so there's a lot of integration involved and a lot of different individual things that have to come together at once, plus combining with typical, putting hardware up in space schedules, things like that. So that made it difficult but it did make it up on Shuttle Discovery in '98. And like I said, I think it was a ten day mission or so.  Host: I was thinking about AMS-02 though, AMS-02.  Brandon Redell: Oh, the AMS-02?  Host: Yeah, AMS-02.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, so it's the same thing. It flew up on STS-134 in 2011, I believe. And yeah, I mean, I think the collaboration after AMS grew, the sixty number I was mentioning, I think that's really AMS-02.  Host: Yeah. Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So it grew after that once it was proved successful and plus it had extra hardware added to it too to help with the measurements. So it's a big integrated effort because, not only is it massive, you need the space shuttle to take it up. It's an external payload, and that's on the outside of the space station, you have the power data connection you had to use ISS communication, the high bandwidth we have, to transmit all that data down and you have a ground station. So there's a lot of working with that that sort of played in setting up all that and -- to help, you know, get that infrastructure in.  Host: Yeah, that's a huge part of the story. I know it was difficult to get up there, you know, you said there was this big collaboration to make AMS-02 this possibility, but, you know, it needed to go to the space station because of how complex it is and you said it's observing so many particles. The space station had an abundance of power and a great system to transmit data that can actually make this thing work in space and I was think one -- maybe the only place that it--  Brandon Redell: Yeah. Right now it's the only place like this, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: I mean, it's a National Laboratory, it’s in orbit up there, couple of hundred kilometers up and it's the only place right now that we could have the infrastructure to do these sorts of things so.  Host: OK. So that's a big part of the story. I did want to take this time though to plug -- and I'll plug it at the end too, there's this great documentary, I don't know if you've seen it. It was actually produced at NASA, here, but it's called \"AMS: The Fight for Flight\". And it's a whole story --  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: -- from AMS-02 to the ground--   Brandon Redell: Yup.  Host: Fighting its way, and then finally getting up to the space station in 134.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, no. I've seen that, that is --  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: I would recommend that too.  Host: Oh, yeah. So that's a great snap shot of the history of AMS. So let's get into what's happening and fixing it. So what is -- what's going on with the AMS that we need to fix it right now?  Brandon Redell: I think, you know, so the AMS originally I think had a three year design life and so we're well passed that, right? It started, I think, what? I think it became operational in 2011, shortly after it was installed. So we're well passed that design life it has, you know, like a lot of satellites and major pieces of hardware, you to want built redundant systems. And so it has these four cooling pumps to help circulate liquid carbon dioxide through the various detector systems to help radiate absorb the heat and then radiate it off into space, right? To help keep the instrumentation cool. The reason why we need to do that is we're measuring these individual particle impacts that are very -- each one by itself is a small amount of energy, but the electronics is very sensitive to temperature, right? If you have very warm electronics you're going to have a lot of electrons bouncing around and it's just noise and it's hard to distinguish between the noise and the actual signals, so if you cool it down you minimize the electron noise. And so that's the purpose of the pumps and I think three of them have pretty much failed and we're on the last one. So the experiment was never designed to, sort of, be fixed in space, so there's been a lot of planning for that. But the idea is to go up there, remove the old system, put up a new pump system and extend the life, and I think the numbers I've seen is that we can extend it probably for the rest of the life of the station since all the other detectors seem to be operating really nice, it's just a matter of getting the cooling pumps. I mean, it's still working now but, you know, we don't have any more redundancy, so if we can those up there and working that'll guarantee more signs.  Host: That's awesome. Now, you as a physicist, I'm sure -- I mean, you're here now talking about this because you're interested in this, why is it important -- why is the AMS important for this discovery?  Brandon Redell: Well, it's important because, you know, we all have the big question of about life, the origin of life, the lower origin of the universe, there's a lot we don't know so ultimately this is answering these big questions. So there's actually multiple fronts. There's a curiosity point, you know, for me I like to add, but in my day to day job I've done a lot of work in the past with cosmic rays and so we're actually gathering a lot of information on cosmic rays. And so NASA's main goal right now is to eventually spend more time out in space, right? Let's say at the Moon and eventually go to Mars, right? So that means more time, radiation's a big problem. So the better we can characterize the radiation and learn how to work in those environments makes a big difference, and so I'm always interested to get more data in that because I enjoy some of the modeling we've done to create that because there's a lot of physics and science involved in that. So I would say just in conjunction with that and just answering fundamental questions about the universe, if we actually find out what if dark matter is and how that plays into cosmological models, you know, that can reveal some information about unknown energy sources that we can maybe tap into also to help for the benefit of humanity. So there's a lot of very futuristic, kind of, goals that come out of this, but it ultimately leads to greater understanding and opening up the gateways for us to explore space.  Host: Yeah, there's multiple different physics disciplines I think that this will help with.  Brandon Redell: Definitely.  Host: And you specifically, you've done a lot of -- you even mentioned, a lot of research on cosmic rays.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: And like you said, the effects on the human body.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: You know, what are some of the things that you studied in terms of how cosmic rays affect the body?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, well, so I didn't necessarily look at the biological damage.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: But there's a whole suite of scientist here at the Space and Live Scientist Group that does a lot of that work. We do know radiation's bad, right? There's two types of effects, there's some called \"acute effects\" which are short term high dose, like we've all seen the movies when, you know, when bombs go off or whatever and there's a lot of radiation, people can die from that, right? So that's a big problem because when we travel to Mars there's bursts from the sun that are high -- could be potentially high sources of radiation. So there's ways to partially shield some of that, so that's always an active experiment or understanding of engineering problem, right? Just how can we maybe avoid shield some of that or what. Using magnetic field is possibly one way to do it, at least the shield part of it but these things, these cosmos rays are very high energy, so we may never fully be able to shield them 100% but understanding the --how the body tries to repair itself on certain kinds of radiation is an active area of research. One of the bigger things that we're trying to protect most our astronauts from right now is the risk of getting cancers from exposures, right? So we're trying to minimize their risk. They're categorized as radiation workers, just like nuclear power plant workers are, slightly different limits to be contusive for space work. But so that's stuff's carefully monitored and practiced when they select crews and so forth, so that's always a consideration. My particular area that I was really focused in on is a lot of people don't know radiation is really bad for electronics. So as opposed to a dose, which is an accumulation of a lot of particles, you can actually have a single particle come in and take out your main processor and your flight computer and you can lose your computer, right? And lose control of the vehicle for it, you know? So there's a lot of engineering designs and so we've designed the Orion vehicles quite hardened to radiation, so that that's been a consideration. And just about any satellite that goes off beyond Low Earth orbit or let's say geosynchronous orbit and beyond, have to consider these things.  Host: Yeah. That's actually -- we had an episode on that.  Brandon Redell: OK. Yeah.  Host: We had an episode on how Orion has radiation hardened.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: And like you said, it could take out computer systems. So the way, you know, understanding how cosmic rays effect that, what they ended up doing is build redundancies.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, and that costs money.  Host: Sure.  Brandon Redell: But in space, in real estate, right? And mass. So you have to figure all these things out. So it's an integrated problem but ultimately it's a reliability problem too. And just one other thing that people might not know is just like radiation doesn't necessarily mean you're going to die if you get an exposure to your body. The analogy for electronics is it doesn't always break parts it can just change your data.  Host: Oh.  Brandon Redell: That's the more dangerous stuff. Is when it flips your data around, how do you handle that? So you have to have smart software and things like that.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So those are all similar things, but radiation in general is one of the bigger risks to a long duration space flight that's still being worked on the human level and to a lesser degree, probably on the electronic side.  Host: Wow. OK.  Brandon Redell: But it's nevertheless, drivers for designs and things like that.  Host: Yeah. So AMS is helping us to understand, kind of, the formation of the universe, but then understand more about these particles and how they may interact with stuff.  Brandon Redell: Well, yeah. It’s so we're learning, you know, we're basically accounting them, right? So we're understanding the distribution of the types of particles and improving our ground base models that let us predict what the fluxes of these particles are, let's say at the Mars orbit or something, right? So when we do -- when we plan flights we try to predict ahead of time what the radiation levels are going to be depending on the length of the mission and the solar cycle, all these things, right? So the AMS data is helping us improve these models.  Host: That's awesome. So, you know, AMS is on the space station, we're coming up on some spacewalks that are helping to fix this piece of equipment well, I guess, like you said, not necessarily fix but just add the redundancies and extent life because some of those cooling pumps have failed, so just adding those. But, you know, we're dedicating human space flight to this effort, you know, we have people going out and fix and what we learn from it can be used for future human space flight. So, you know, you being a physicist, why is it important to explore with humans?  Brandon Redell: Well, you know, this is a question that has answers, pros and cons both ways, right? I think most people probably would consider robotic maybe as a pathfinder for humans. Obviously, sending humans is a risk, right? So there's always that risk that we have to weigh for. But some of the advantages for human space flight, I would say, you know, humans can have -- make quick decisions when need to be. I remember when Apollo 17 astronauts talking about their mission, looking at the geology on the Moon and so forth, you know? So in the course of eight hours I think they covered twenty two miles of surface. Well, if you look at Mars Opportunity Rover, it took eight years to cover that same area. So functionally, I mean, I think humans because you can make the decisions to cover more territory, might be a little bit more efficient once the, let's say, they establish, an infrastructure's established. And also humans maybe can deploy certain things if we're looking at, let's say, drilling for In Situ Resource Utilization, that's a hard thing to do with satellites -- I mean, with robotics controlled through satellites, and so forth. So I think there's some advantages to have humans doing some of that work. Certainly, if we're going to have a human presence somewhere, maybe for scouting out territories or things like that, that might be better off for robotic type missions. But I think in the end because we want a human presence, we have to prepare to get us used to working in these environments and so forth, so there's that part of it too. So I think they both have their uses, it's just really what phase in the exploration we're in. Also, some of the robotic missions can go to hostile environments that we can't do with humans, so that's the advantage probably for robotics as well.  Host: Yeah. And we get a lot of the same answers but I just love asking that question.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Because we're in the business of human space life. So just I think, you know, one of the biggest things that I appreciate definitely is the inspiration value. I mean, you’re not going to get someone too attached to a robot but you can see them really, really feeling like the same feelings with a person.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Going to explore.  Brandon Redell: Yeah. And I would say -- I would just add, like, if we're just strictly talking -- if I'm only interested if particle physics, I don't need a human to do that right? We can build a detector and send it somewhere.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: And that's just as good from that perspective.  Host: You don't want a person grabbing particles as they go through?  Brandon Redell: Well, it's just unnecessary really. But I think overall, in the category of human space exploration, you have to have humans involved, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: And there's efficient reasons why to do that.  Host: Yeah. Well, Brandon Reddell thank you so much for coming on and taking us through this history of astrophysics, cosmology and AMS, all fascinating stuff. I think I stayed in step with you, I think.  Brandon Redell: Well.  Host: But if not, we'll have you on again because I can talk about this I think all day.  Brandon Redell: Oh, great.  Host: It's just so fascinating.  Brandon Redell: All right. Well, appreciate it.  Host: Appreciate your time.  Brandon Redell: All right. Well, thank you and I appreciate the time and I hope it made sense too. Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I hope you enjoyed this conversation about the science of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and some basics of astrophysics and cosmology with Dr. Brandon Reddell. Definitely a fascinating discussion and I really should have him back on to talk more about this stuff because it's super interesting. If you like podcasts there's actually a few more NASA podcasts that you can listen to, I know specifically gravity assist goes into a lot of planetary science and talks a lot about these astrophysics and cosmology, it goes deep into that so you could definitely listen to them. Otherwise, check out some of the many other shows on NASA.gov/podcast. We're going to have updates on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer at NASA.gov/ISS and you can watch the spacewalks live. Just go to NASA.gov/NTV you can look at the schedule there and see when the spacewalks are going to be. I would highly recommended that you watch the NASA documentary called \"AMS: The Fight for Flight\" and learn more about the history and struggle of getting the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the space station. It's available through the link in the episode web page. If you have a question for us go to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram we're on the NASA Johnson Space Center pages of any one of those social media platforms, whichever one you like best, use the hashtag #askNASA on your favorite platform to submit an idea for the show, make sure to mention it's for \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\" This episode was recorded on October 8, 2019. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Norah Moran, Belinda Pulido, Rachel Berry and the International Space Station Program Science Office team. Thanks again to Dr. Brandon Reddell for taking the time to come on the show. And we'll be back next week with more about the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer."

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 162, “CONNECT during Social Isolation.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight, and today even our own lives. 2020 has been a crazy year with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of us are affected by it in how we live and work now every day. It's very difficult to go out or to do things or to see people. I know for me personally, I haven't seen my friends or family in, well, what seems like forever now. This is a very similar story to astronauts. They describe life away from family for long periods of time during space station expeditions. Of course, they miss their families, but they seem to always make note of keeping in regular contact with them. Keeping remote connection with others from the International Space Station can be a form of a countermeasure or a preventative measure from feeling isolated. So, astronauts can maximize their performance and get all kinds of science and spacewalking and maintenance done in their crazy busy schedules on orbit. There is an approach or a method or whatever you want to call it that can serve for a useful reminder for the different ways in which NASA helps our astronauts deal with the isolation and confinement on long space missions. And, that reminder is called CONNECT. Of course, it's an acronym. It stands for Community, Openness, Networking, Needs, Expeditionary mindset, Countermeasures, and finally Training and preparation. On today's episode, we're going to explore NASA's CONNECT method and how we can use what NASA does for our astronauts to find ways to connect in our own lives thinking about the stresses that comes with isolation. So, joining me is Dr. Tom Williams, now three-time guest of the podcast who is the Element Scientist for Human Factors and Behavioral Performance in the Human Research Program here at the Johnson Space Center. So here we go, using the NASA CONNECT method in our own lives with Dr. Tom Williams. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Dr. Tom Williams. Thank you so much for returning to Houston We Have a Podcast.  Tom Williams: Gary, thanks so much for having me back. It'll be a real pleasure for me to share some of these thoughts with you today.   Host: Absolutely. And it's a very timely discussion I think that we're having. It's all about social isolation, which is something that I know I personally am very used to and I think a lot of our listeners are as well. And, I'm very interested to talk about this because it's not only something that is applied to human spaceflight but it's something that can be brought into our own lives here on Earth. And, I'm very excited to get right into it. Let's start, though, with getting a good understanding of just what we're talking about here and why we have to implement this thing called the CONNECT reminder. We'll get into that shortly. But, first sort of setting the scene on social isolation. What is, Dr. Williams, what is social isolation?  Tom Williams: Well thanks so much. And, it's really an important topic just as you said. All over the world we're all dealing with it. Social isolation is really when we either voluntarily or intentionally withdraw from social contact with others. You know, with our astronauts we, they voluntarily agree to complete a long duration mission. And, for many of us today, we're kind of struggling to maintain the social isolation that they volunteer to engage in. And, so it's important that we kind of distinguish between being socially isolated and feeling lonely.  Host: Interesting. So, let's dive into that. What are those feelings? Give us a little, a little comparison on that. The, what can come with the results from social isolation and I guess how that compares to the traditional sense of loneliness?  Tom Williams: Yeah. Great question. So, when we think about being socially isolated, feeling socially isolated versus feeling lonely. Again, social isolation is when we self-impose a withdraw away from other people or we do it as a result of being requested as we are now. And that's, unfortunately, when we withdraw, that's often viewed as a precursor to depression. People who become depressed, they don't want to be around other people. And, the consequence of that, loneliness is a common experience. All of us get lonely from time to time. And, but it's not always aversive. It becomes only aversive when we sort of self-exile and withdrawing from basically everything around us. And, we no longer kind of confront the ways that, through our day to day activities, we grow. So, when we withdraw, we tend to not foster our personal growth like we could. So, loneliness really kind of sets up an activation of a set of complex feelings. And, some of those result in negative feelings and then the negative reactions we have can be perceived by those who care about us, they see us withdrawing, they get concerned about us. And, we don't reach out as much. So, it really starts to impact on our relationship with others and it kind of doesn't allow us to meet our social needs. And, that's why we get concerned and attentive to how we socially isolate and how that may set us up for loneliness.  Host: That's right. And, you've already gone through a few of those effects of what social isolation can do to a person. You've mentioned depression and you've mentioned this almost stand off-ishness from those who made try to connect with you, if you're trying to socially isolate. Are these sort of the symptoms of what can come from social isolation?  Tom Williams: They can indeed. You know, it's interesting, a 2018 national survey by Cigna Insurance, even before COVID hit, looked at 20,000 U.S. adults. And it really concluded, loneliness is at an all-time high. And, like 40% of all the survey participants reported that they're, sometimes they always feel like their relationships aren't as meaningful as they feel like they need to be, and they feel isolated. And, what's really interesting is that they're really differed by age groups, kind of surprisingly. We used to always think that our elderly were the most at risk. But, what's interesting about this most recent survey is the fact that Gen Zers, the 18 to 22-year old’s and the Millennials, the 23 to 37-year old’s are really lonelier and really claim to being more so than our older generation. Now social media use alone doesn't seem to be the predictor of the loneliest, loneliness. It's not that they're turning into their devices and away from other people. Which is sort of interesting now when we think about the impact of COVID where we are using technology more. But the student actually had higher loneliness scores than retirees did. And, there didn't seem to be a big difference between men and women, and no differences, major differences between the races to when it came to averaging. So, it's really important that we look at there are ways that we can be less lonely, and we can have those regular in person interactions. And, when we do that there tends to be a good overall physical and mental health benefit. And, when we find that balance, that's when we seem to do the best.  Host: I'm very curious to explore some of that. And, I love you diving into some of the statistics there for something we can describe on Earth. I think what's fascinating about talking to you, Dr. Williams, is that this is something that we in the world of spaceflight here at NASA relate to very often, you know, this, the whole world right now is experiencing this social isolation. Being told, you know, for the benefit of others that this is one of the better ways to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, the novel Coronavirus. But it is, it does has a lot of comparisons to human spaceflight. An astronaut very much separated from everything he or she knows. Can you talk about some of the ways that social isolation that we're looking into how it may affect or some of the, or some of the symptoms and, I guess, adverse conditions that can come from an astronaut that is social isolating?  Tom Williams: Great question again. Thanks, so much for that. Because, it really is, it's one of the reason NASA's identified isolation as one of the five spaceflight hazards for a long duration mission to Mars. We understand how being isolated from those you love, from society as a whole can be stressful. And, in fact, it's something that we spend a lot of time researching in different environments over extended periods of time. And, what we do is we set up analogs, analogs that are focused on isolating the research participants, confining them within that analog setting. And, we try to do this in an extreme environment so that the crews within those analogs can experience something close to the stressors that maybe our crews are being exposed to on a long duration space exploration mission. So, we've done this research with scientists and other individuals who are typically doing winter overs in Antarctica, for example, for 12 or more months. And what we learned is that often times there's something that's been described as a winter over syndrome. That's when the individuals start to withdraw from one another. They become more socially narrowing in their processes. So, they kind of socially withdraw as the mission extends. That means they start to spend more time alone in their rooms. And, of course, that would be difficult to achieve on a small spacecraft. And, so then that could potentially create a tension. And, if that tension is there, the irritability sometimes also increases with our research participants, somatic complaints, they get more aches and pains. And, so if a crew member starts to have an increased medical complaint, they're too far from Earth to get any medical care that might, that we might have here in Houston. So, it really becomes something that we need to fully understand and better get a grip on in terms of how does this social isolation impact? Because as people become more socially isolated, they also become more territorial. When they put something down, they don't want somebody else to move it. And, they may complain more about feeling down or depressed. Sometimes they have problems concentrating and sometimes sleeping and sometimes they report problems with memory. So, you can start to see why it's so important for NASA to understand how this long-term isolation can impact on our crew. We don't know for sure if the same thing with our crew will be experienced. But we need to be ready to help them if they do experience this way.  Host: And, I think that's a fascinating point to zoom in on is not just the social isolation thing that maybe we can think of when you think about a single person barricading themselves and isolating from others. The idea of isolating in groups. I know a lot of us are stuck at home with our, with our families, whether it's a loved one, whether it's a mother, father figure, whether it's a wife or husband. And, you know, adding into the stresses of social isolating, now you have to perform with this, with your family with your crew the same that an astronaut would. And, the stresses of socially isolating being with just those people, there's a factor of how, I guess, you respond to those people, you know, a heightened sense of irritability. It seems like there's a lot of parallels with the crews studying how isolation effects crews in all of these analogs, you know, like the winter over months for Antarctic crews, astronauts, but even our own families.  Tom Williams: That's exactly right. That's a huge factor. Primarily because when you start to feel that disconnected, isolated, and alone, and you can be around people and feel somewhat isolated and alone. And, so that social narrating, that narrowing, that becoming more irritable, less patient, often times is a result of feeling kind of crowded, feeling like you've got, you're trying to balance multiple demands, multiple roles. Like you're the office mate, you're the spouse, you're the mother, you're the father, you're the student. Multiple roles are now being demanded of you. And, that's putting pressure on you to try to confront some of the ways to manage all those different stressors. And, sometimes dealing with that stress kind of increases the potential risk of now not, kind of handling the responses to those situations effectively, which then adds more stress as tension starts to mount between you and the other members of your family or the group that you're isolating with. So that's why it becomes so important that we, we understand that and be able to effectively deal with it. And, you know, every, every time we get a delivery, I know more people are getting deliveries at home. But, every time we get a delivery, there's some calculated risk that we're encountering. So, it becomes important that we sort of look at it in the same way an astronaut going out on an EVA or a spacewalk. They're going out in a high-risk hazardous environment. If we go out, we've got to take precautions. They're, they get a lot of hundreds of hours of physical and mental training to do something. And, they go out in a completely protective suit designed to protect them against the hazards. But, taking actions in that suit, in that hazardous environment is very demanding. It produces stress. It produces fatigue. They confront that. And, we can all learn from that by doing kind of the mental check on our own gear as we get ready to go out the door to go get groceries or whatever we may need to do, taking those appropriate precautions. And, that can decrease the stress of the environment that we currently find ourselves in.  Host: I'm loving the parallels here between astronauts in space and what we're experiencing now in our own lives. And, with this foundation set of understanding what social isolation is and how it can be affecting us, all of these parallels brings up this reminder, this acronym called CONNECT. And, it's something that I believe we apply or at least have astronauts have in the back of their mind as a reminder to counteract some of these effects that could happen from isolation. So, Tom, kind of introduce this for us. What is this reminder called CONNECT?  Tom Williams: Thank you. The CONNECT is, it's sort of a mnemonic that we've coined to really try to pass on the lessons learned that we've used with astronauts for a long period of time. So, it's not a formal NASA program. But, it's just a good reminder of the seven different considerations that we can all take into account that may help us all better cope and adapt to the demands of social isolation. So, it's an acronym, that CONNECT, that C O N N E C [T] and does a play on words. If we think of those seven things we can do, that helps us connect. And, if we're feeling more connected, we're feeling less socially isolated. So, it's just a useful reminder of actions we can consider and take. And, like any good team member on a spacecraft, potentially use as a gentle reminder to others to consider taking when we see that we may need increased coping, or they see we may need increased coping. And, it just gives us a potential stress reduction strategy. So that's, that's why we're using this as a useful reminder for ourselves and for others we care about in the same way crew would do the same team care on station.  Host: Wonderful. Now let's dive right in to CONNECT addressing both the space related and Earth related applications at each step starting with the first C.  Tom Williams: That's great. So, Community is a big one. That's kind of the foundation. We're all socially isolating now as gesture to protect other members within our community. And, in the same way, the crew will take steps to get trained up. And, they're isolating to go out on an expedition to advance the reaches of space exploration. So, they're heavily involved in the community. They're doing lots of public affairs events to stay connected with our community, to inspire students to become more focused on STEM, the science technology math components. So, we really focus on how do we link this increased reliance on a more limited contained environment to the fact that we're helping take care of our community as we do so? So, we do that by taking a more positive approach. And, the challenge for us is to become  innovative in that new normal until we can do a reentry. Just like crew will come back to Earth from a space exploration mission. So, when the virus clears, how do we prepare ourselves to come back to that more normal social interactions? So, finding a way to focus on our isolation is a way that we advance the interest of our community, we protect our community, but we're still part of our community. And, that's the importance of why we're socially isolating. That becomes our C in the first letter of CONNECT.  Host: I love that, there's a, there's a lot of themes within that first C, within that community. There's this theme of positivity, looking for the positive. And, there's, there's also, and correct me if I'm wrong here. It seems like there's a sense of purpose. And, that purpose is, is pulled gently away from the self, from you, and that purpose is driven more toward the people that surround you, your community. So, as you mentioned the purpose of, you know, wearing a mask in your community, what you're doing there is your purpose is to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. So, if you were to be a silent carrier, as we're all learning is may be the case, wearing that mask is the purpose that drives you to protect those around you.  Tom Williams: That's such a great point. And, the other night we had a presentation on the overview effect. And, on one of the things that crew members will report on in seeing the Earth from space, they really had this sense of awe and a greater sense of connection to all of humankind on Earth. And, that's a way that their experience in space really intensely connects them to the community below them. They don't see borders, they just see humankind. And, that's a great example that you've provided of how that represents that community with spaceflight and the need for us all to look how we're all in this together. And, the actions each of us take promotes the interest of the others.  Host: That's very, very powerful, that sense of purpose. Now let's move on to the next one, O that stands for Openness.  Tom Williams: Openness really tells us that we are in a challenging situation. We're being asked to do things we don't typically do. And so that really demands kind of a call for a greater openness to try new things, to be open to doing something other than what we've always tried to do. So, it really helps us recognize the importance that we now have an increased reliance on each member of our team, our community. And, that we've got to be able to find ways to promote and actively seek ways to take on this challenge with hope and preparedness just like we talked about with our crew. So, we've got to accept the new normal. But that doesn't mean we just sit there and take it. We look for interesting innovative ways being more open to the possibilities. And, that's really sort of what resiliency is for us. When we think about being more resilient, it means that we can appraise what's happening, we can take positive steps to cope with what's happening, and then we take steps to eliminate the sources of stress. And, it's how it's really how we're thinking about it. You know? Henry Ford once said, “when you think you can or think you can't, you're right.” Meaning that how you think about the situation will often determine how you cope with the situation. So, we really need to be open to the possibilities to how do we self-regulate in this environment so that we don't let stress get out of control? And, resilience really kind of tells us, we can find ways to positively adapt despite the significance of the adversity we might be encountering. And, that gives us the ability to kind of bounce back to our prestress levels of functioning so that we can maintain a sustainable equilibrium in our own life and that's that self-regulating part. We spend a lot of time with crew training them on these techniques. So that we can identify ways, regardless of the situation that arises, you've got resources and resiliency to contend with those, to meet the difficult demanding situations. And, that's what gets us to a more positive adaptation as we confront these stressors.  Host: So, you talked about, you talked about resilience as one of those things that can be a stressor. And, you talked about techniques that we can, we and astronauts can use to create a better sense of openness. What are those techniques?  Tom Williams: Well resilience is really a good way, it's a way that we describe how someone positively adapts to a difficult situation. So, one of the things that we do is to do resiliency training, to give you processes on how to cope with different situations. One of those is mindfulness training. So, being mindful of how something is impacting on you emotionally and then trying to do a self-assessment of why is it having this impact? So, when we think about often times someone says something a certain way and we might misinterpret it. So, we got to kind of step back and do a reassessment of that and say. Was there an intention there for someone to say it that way? You know? And, one of the things we know is that sometimes people get into conflict when they're in a more confined environment. And, there's an old saying in psychology that good mental health is not the absence of conflict but how you handle the conflict. And, so when we are more open to finding more positive ways to adapt or handle conflict, there's always going to be the opportunity for a more positive outcome. And, when we have more positive outcomes, that's what's stressful and that's what we need to stay open to finding ways, innovative ways, to be more adaptive more positive about this experience. And, that will help us all cope better.  Host: These, even just these first two, Dr. Williams, community and openness seem like positivity takes on this, this forward theme for both of them. And, what I think what's very interesting is it's a lot about nurturing that positivity and in turn nurturing that positivity creates a more positive environment. And, it sounds like creating that positive environment is one of those powerful things that you can do to reduce or possibly even eliminate some of the stressors that come with social isolation.  Tom Williams: You know, absolutely. And, just relating that, just think of a long duration mission, three years. And, if you can't find ways to kind of maintain positive relationships among the small crew, that could be a long mission made longer by the sense of stress that would be produced. So that's where the team care and being mindful of how we relate to others, being kind of alert to what actions we're taking and how it may impact on others becomes so important at times like this and on long duration space exploration missions.  Host: Now let's move on to the next one. We've gone through C and O, Community and Openness. The next one is Networking.  Tom Williams: And, Networking is so important. And, this is one where, at its very core, is how we really reach out with the ones we love, to family, to friends, and the importance of seeking kind of innovative ways to connect with them. So that can be through technology, that can be finding new ways to communicate with them. Because part of what the isolation does for us it takes away that face to face opportunity. So now the ability to network becomes important that we find ways to reach out. What's really interesting about this is, when you look at some of the research related to being happy, finding ways to connect to people near you that are happy, increases your own sense of happiness. Kind of related to the point that you helped us make on the more positive nature. So, it's really important that we network, find ways to connect with those we love. And, that may be challenging at times, because maybe some of our older parents or grandparents may not have some of the same technological connections that we do. And, they may feel, you may feel like you don't have as many ways to do that. But you can write people. People are increasingly writing now while they're isolated. We also have to be mindful that some of us are more sensitive to the connections with others also tend to be highly sensitive to the absence of those connections. So sometimes people just need those connections. And, so we may find that some of our friends are reaching out more. And, we're hesitant. Because, in a social relationship, we may not want as much connection, but they may need it. And, so being mindful that everybody's needs with connection may differ. And, importantly, when our needs aren't met, that's when we find it more difficult to apply our coping skills. So that's where we have to be adaptive. And if we're not kind of meeting or getting our coping skills met, that's when we sort of feel out of it. And, that's when sometimes, if someone reaches out and we don't reach back, that may lead to a perception of not feeling like we're worthy. That somehow, because they didn't reach back in a timely way, that that's a testament to our own sense of worth in their eyes. And, that's, that's something we really want to avoid and get away from. And, that takes us back to being open to the possibility that maybe some other demand has been placed on them and they don't have the time to respond immediately. When we're in social interactions, we can read those cues more effectively. When we're more isolated and trying to read it through the networking capabilities we have now, that becomes less able for us to do that. So those with high social skills usually are least likely to feel lonely or to feel socially isolated because they are going to reach out. So, if we know we have friends that are that way, we'll expect them to reach out more. But it also tells us not to ignore those who don't have as many social skills. And, certainly, with our crews, understanding their natures, the composition of the team that gets put together and finding ways to relate to one another. Because the reality is, we often contrast our own experiences with those we observe in others. So, as we see people relating, as we see how they're relating to others, that helps us learn how to relate as well. And, when we're isolated, we lose that opportunity. So that reinforces the importance of being attuned to the need to network, particularly with our family, friends, and those we care about and those who may need that support. And, we see all sorts of reports of that in the news where people are finding innovative ways to reach out.  Host: And, I know, I'm the result of that too. I've been part of many a Zoom call to a lot of family members and friends. Just one of those ways that you have to, that you have to connect nowadays. And, I'm interested to see how that relates to astronaut's, I guess now, on the International Space Station. I’m sure it’s going to be a little bit more prominent as they go farther away. But what are some of those ways that astronauts are using this networking method to connect with others?  Tom Williams: So that's, they have a great opportunity to reach down, calling their families. There are oftentimes PAO [Public Affairs Office] events that allow them to connect to network to share the experiences of what they're doing. Which, in many ways, makes it more meaningful for them when they're able to relate what they're doing in space and help inspire and share the excitement with those of us here on Earth. And, it also, from time to time, they're allowed to reach out to celebrities. And, so calls are set up between them and a, maybe a celebrity, a movie star or something to share those experiences. So, there's many different ways they network. And, it's important for them and their families to stay, to keep connected. And, that, of course, is one of the concerns we have of long duration missions. Because we really see the importance of that networking and recognize with a long duration mission there'll be communication delays because of the distance that the signal would have to travel. And, how might that change the feeling of connection that you get when you network? And, so you get the message, but that message was 10 minutes ago or 20 minutes ago and now your response will take another 20 minutes to get back to them. So how might that change that sense of connection? And those are important research areas that we have underway.  Host: Yeah. It'll be interesting to see how that plays out without that conversational feel that instant feedback that you get when you say something and somebody responds to it, not being able to have that. So that's definitely one of those things that'll be very interesting. Let's move on to the next one. Next one is another N and it stands for needs.  Tom Williams: You know needs are so important at times like these. Because, really the challenges in isolation sort of help us realize that we importantly have to attend to our physiological health, our emotional health, and the psychological needs that we have. So, when we think about our physiological, emotional, and psychological needs, it's important that we understand, if we don't attend to those needs, it starts to diminish our enjoyment of life. So if we're not eating right, if we're not getting enough rest, sleep, if we're not self-regulating some of the emotional reactions that we might have to some of the stressors, if we're not attending to those things that give us meaning and purpose in life, then that starts to cause us to be more controlled by the circumstances than to feel like we're in control of our settings and our environment. And, that gives us not only a loss of a sense of isolation, but a loss of the sense of control. So, attending to those physiological, emotional, and psychological needs become really important. And, it helps us also recognize how we maintain control over our health and wellbeing for both ourselves and those we care about who may be either living with us or, when we're networking with our friends, paying attention to how they're dealing with it. Now, like our crews, we train them in mindfulness as we related to earlier. And, that's to help them remain aware of how the experiences that they're having may impact on them. And, that gives them that sense of control, that sense of purpose. And, if we don't do that, if we're not attending to those experiences, again, that starts to diminish our, our purpose, our sense of wellbeing. And, it really actually results in a reduction in the enjoyment of life. So, the self-care becomes really important when we're isolated. The self-care focused on not only ourselves, but really being attuned, just like crew members are, to how the needs are being met by others, their other members of the crew. The team care is really, really important. And, if you're noticing something about another member of the team, being mindful of how can you set conditions to make it more positive for them. And, you know, one little thing we all can do that, you know, a great article in Health Psychology, a “Randomized Trial.” So really a good scientific approach helped address even sitting upright, you know, an upright seated posture helps us maintain self-esteem and it reduces our negative mood and increases positive mood. So being attuned to our body posture, not allowing ourselves to slump as we sit at home trying to continue our work. One small gesture can have a huge impact. And, so it really helps us realize that, with isolation, getting a personal sense of control, helps us decrease that growing sense of the circumstances that tend to feel like they're beyond our control. And, so it really, it's important that we find ways to kind of psychologically reframe our isolation and to help us recognize that we're really maintaining the isolation to actually maintain our control over own health and wellbeing. And, so reframing it, making sure that, as we remain isolated, if we reframe it, we can have that greater sense of control. You know, some people in isolation start to report having more vivid dreams. So, I always like to remind people, you know, when we're isolating to avoid coming in contact with the virus, that gives us the free exercise of the emotional expression of our dreams. So, someone who's healthy in isolation can have a thousand dreams. While someone exposed to COVID-19 and you become sick with it, has but one dream, one goal, and that's to not become seriously ill or to cause someone else to becomes seriously ill. So it really becomes important to reframe the situation, meet our needs, and recognize, as we're doing so, we're really, again, promoting our physical, emotional, and psychological needs because we don't want to live the rest of our lives with a sense of guilt on potentially contaminating someone else.  Host: Yeah. There's a lot to this, to this particular part of the reminder CONNECT, the needs. I think, I think another one, what's interesting is that you talked a lot about the mental wellbeing and about others. I think, I think what's very interesting is just how important those physiological needs are just keeping your body healthy. You know, things that can help you in the sense of social isolation can be eating right and getting enough sleep and exercising, all things, I think, a lot of people are having trouble with as gyms are either closed or very high-risk environments. And, you know, we, you start sacrificing things like sleep and like having some good food, just making sure that you're attending to those very basic needs.  Tom Williams: That's another great reinforcement in that point. Because one thing we see is a lot of people kind of going back to the openness and using the openness to meet these needs. And, that is people are innovatively finding ways to exercise where they live. So, they're creatively looking at different ways to do exactly as, in the point you made, and that is to maintain that physical fitness and that component of ranging their environment to be more conducive to meeting their physiological, emotional, and psychological needs. And, that's important that we remain open and creatively look for ways to do that to help ensure those needs are being met.  Host: Now this next one is interesting. It's called Expeditionary Mindset. Now what exactly is that?  Tom Williams: You know, this is a really important one and it's really, you'll see a number of the astronauts have commented on social isolation and they really pull from an expeditionary skills model. So, when we think about in expedition, we're thinking about you're now heading out doing something, kind of a sense of adventure, there's a readiness to respond, you're learning from success of others, you're sharing the successes you have. You realize there's going to be challenges that are going to be coming your way. You take a lot of steps to kind of foster a sense of readiness to respond to whatever those challenges may be. You kind of use the challenge to create a sense of adventure. And, you remain open to the challenges that you're going to confront. So that's really what has helped others who have engaged in historical expeditions, that's how they succeeded. They studied, what did others confront? How did they succeed? How do we prepare? What are the challenges we're confronting? How do we learn to address them with the limited or no help that we might have? And, how do we continually hone our skill sets for doing so? That's kind of what we mean by an expeditionary mindset. That we don't say we're stuck in this environment, there's not much we can do, we say look, this, if we adopt an expeditionary mindset, we approach it by saying you know what, we realize that others are going through this, others are learning from it. How can we capitalize on what they're doing? How can we build on that success? How do we build on our own success? What works? What doesn't work? How do we pull our family together? Kind of again getting the team activated so that we identify and respect the roles and responsibility that each of us have in the success of the mission in the same way the crew would do, each has a role and responsibility? How do we, how do we arrange our family, our others that we're living with to make sure that everyone feels worthy, they're contributing even in small ways for the success of this expedition of social isolation mission that we're all engaged in?  Host: Now, I think what's interesting is, is you talk about Expeditionary Mindset. And, I'm relating it to expeditions as we know it on the International Space Station usually six months sometimes a little bit longer. Christina Koch being up there for nearly a year and then the same with Scott Kelly. I think what's different about the way that astronauts today approach their expedition missions on the space station is that there is an end date. And, I think there are these expeditionary skills and I wonder if there is a sort of ease with knowing that, or at least having a sense, of when you're going to come back and then things are going to return to sort of normal. So how can we, how can we use this expeditionary mindset in a way that we are uncertain of the end date?  Tom Williams: Yeah, but it's such an important point. And, I think it's something that we would all like to know and I think and sometimes with crew. Sometimes they thought they had an end date and it gets extended due to orbital mechanics or due to just the scheduling. And, so I think that they, at times, have had to confront, sort of what we're confronting. And, I know, sometimes, military members think that their deployment is going to end at a certain time, and it gets extended. So, looking at some of those experiences, the importance is setting objectives to overcome how to get through particular set points in the duration. So, we don't know when it's going to end. But, how do we set objectives to say, “in the next month, here's what I want to achieve.” And, so each month you can set new objectives knowing that these are steps within an overall mission. And, we can pretty much imagine that there should be a vaccine available by next January, February, that's sort of the mark on the wall for a lot of us, I think. And, so setting objectives to overcome the challenges we're likely to confront, and importantly the expeditionary mindset says we've got to share our successes. What is it that we're doing that's helping us bide the time? You know, one of the things we do with crew is have them grow plants and try to look at there's a cycle of plant growing that farmers have long used to kind of measure the time across the summer. So, are there things that we can do, objectives that we set for ourselves? Some people are trying to learn a new language. How do we reframe this to say I want to achieve this before it ends? And, that gives you objectives. So, you're now more focused on the objectives that you're working toward rather than the time. Because if we just focus on the time, that will seem like a longer time for it to get here. If we focus on things we can achieve as time passes, then that gives us something that keeps it more positive, more open, more creative, and it better meets our psychological needs.  Host: Now we've gone through a lot of the CONNECT reminder so far, Community, Openness, Networking, Needs, and Expeditionary Mindset. The next C is Countermeasures.  Tom Williams: Another really important one because, with our crew, we really focus on we've identified spaceflight hazards. How do we develop countermeasures so that those hazards don't have a dramatic or an adverse impact on the crew? And, in the same way we need to think about countermeasures that we might engage or bring into our homes that would help us maintain a sense of control over how this social isolation is impacting on us. So, the strategies to maintain that sense of connection with others is really what we're after here to reduce the sense of isolation. So, I alluded to this a little earlier where onboard the International Space Station, we’ll sometimes, we'll deliver care packages or arrange connections with family members via the communications network or have the communications with MCC, the Mission Control Center during operational activity. So, crew will be having social interactions as they're performing different tasks. So that tells us something. As we're doing things, can we reach out to someone, someone who's always had a talent for getting something done at a certain way? Can we Zoom with them or have some activity where we sustain a connection with them and then grow as a result of that connection? So that becomes a countermeasure to some of the stress. So how do we continue to direct our focus on engaging in some kind of activity with others that reduces the isolation? So that's part of a countermeasure identifying ways to reduce our stress, to reduce the demands that we feel in the isolation. And, so just like with our crew, we all need to be sensitive to how the isolation may impact on each of us differently. Each crew member has different capabilities. Each member of our family or each of our loved ones may have different abilities to deal with the social isolation. So, it really becomes important, again, as we talked about earlier, to remain mindful of those differences and to be responsive to them in the way they need us to be. That's part of the countermeasures that we also train the crew on, being mentally prepared for the isolation. Having a mental acceptance that a period of time is going to pass while we have to be socially isolated. And, then recognizing that different stressors are going to trigger potentially different coping strategies in us. And, each of us may differ in how we deal with it. And, so we may think the best way to deal with it is the way we're dealing with it where another member of the family or whomever we're living with is dealing with it differently. And, we're wanting to try to make them change to our way, which it may be exactly meeting their needs at that point.  Host: I think what's unique about this COVID-19 situation that we're all in is you talked a lot about understanding and connecting with people and finding ways to do so with a lot of folks that may have different needs. I think what's also challenging, especially in these times is, I guess we're recording this, what is it, it's August now that we're recording this. We've been in social isolation, at least, at least I have since March. And, I think what's most surprising about this whole thing is just how long this thing is going on. So not only identifying and finding these ways to sustain the, to have a connection and to find the right connections, depending on the people that you want to connect with. But what are those ways that we can make sure that we are sustaining these connections and we're regularly performing these practices without tiring out. Because I got to say, sometimes, sometimes I get pretty tired of these Zoom calls, sometimes I just want to call it quits. But, what can we do to make sure that we are, we're hanging in there, that we're hanging in the game for the long run?  Tom Williams: What a great question that is. And, you know, one of the ways, and we sort of talked about this earlier with the being open and finding different ways to connect. But the best approach when you start to get tired is reframe it. And reframing doesn't mean you're denying the facts, reframing says I'm going to use my openness and creativity to think of a different way of appreciating this to take advantage of the opportunity that it presents. So sometimes we don't think about isolation as giving us a potential for a healthy sense of renewal, a healthy sense of reflection, and greater insight into what we’re like, into what those we care about are like, and to help people deal with this. So, we reframe it. We look for ways to take advantage of the opportunity, and not just look for ways that it's impacting on us negatively. And importantly, kind of thinking about when we're using technology, it's not the same as a face to face, so therefore we may need to use shorter snippets of it. A five-hour Zoom call is not the same as sitting in your back yard for five hours with someone you care about and sharing stories. So, there's a little extra demand that's placed on you, so you fatigue more quickly. And it's always better to leave a communication where both are wanting more, than one of the two parties is feeling like, gosh, we should have ended that an hour ago. So being alert to that, and being mindful of it, can really help. Because that's what we, we train our crews to increase and sustain their healthy connections with each other in isolation, with those back on Earth, and I think all of us probably can benefit to being alert to when we have a negative thought about something that may creep in, and then counter those negative thoughts. And one way that might help is like we do with crew, you journal. You use this time to journal, listing out the, kind of the activities that you're engaged in, what did you find positive, what didn't you find so positive, and then purposefully try to find a more positive tilt to it, to look at ways that you can grow from it. And that actually helps stimulate your brain a little more to give you greater sensory stimulation. Because that's the other thing we have to worry about, you're not getting as much stimulation when you're in the four walls all the time. If we went outside, we would see trees, we'd feel breeze, we would get multiple stimuli. Same thing has happened with crew, they're not getting as much stimulation, how do we find ways to stimulate you more? And that's one way to reframe it, find positive ways to use what you can to put more context in it, like journaling, like being alert to those feelings you have.  Host: Well, Dr. Williams, we made it to the end. We're at the T now in the CONNECT reminder. This one stands for Training and Preparation.  Tom Williams: And so, Training, and it really relates back to our being able to learn and grow from what we've been prepared to do. So, when we select crew, we look for individuals who demonstrated success in a variety of challenges. Because it's from those experiences where they have achieved psychological growth, where they've encountered different adversity and shown that they've got the resiliency, and they demonstrate to us that they've got a readiness for new and uncertain challenges that may lie ahead. That's what we need to do. Each of us have, we've all confronted different challenges in our past, we've learned from them, we've grown from them. And if we think about it, each one of those experiences helped us become better prepared for the next one, whether it's been a negative experience. If we reframed it, we can look at any experience and try to bring some positivity out of it, if we've grown from it in some way. Life is that way. We've pull from all of our previous experiences, from the training, the growth, the preparation, that's where we have that adversity that presents in our life we can grow from. We draw from our inner strengths, and from the inner strengths, at times, that others may provide. That's a good, positive psychology approach, we think about what went well, how do we identify and activate the strengths that we have to confront the risk that's before us, in this case, the isolation. And then with someone that's helped us, and maybe they're reaching out to us, and sharing a greater sense of control over the social isolation, how do we express our gratitude? One of the most powerful things in psychology we can do is someone who's had a positive impact on your life is to reach out to them. Maybe set up a Zoom call that's specific to say thank you, that the whole purpose of your connection is to say thank you. That is a powerful call. We've sometimes told people to make a special trip, write a letter, and then take a special trip to go read the letter in the presence of the person that you have gratitude for. Maybe it was a teacher, maybe it was someone who had a positive impact, a grandparent, a father, a mother, a sister, brother, somebody who had a really positive impact on your life. Think of the power of that, the meaning, the purpose that gives you. That becomes a powerful way to take the preparation, the training that you've had from life and to grow from it. So, as we look at this, as we think about, we all share the danger that's prompting our social isolation. And when we humans share a common danger, if you think about after a storm, people tend to congregate out in the street, and there's greater connection, greater bonds that tend to draw people together. So, we feel the danger that those type of disasters have prompted in the past, but we can't connect. The COVID threat creates the danger, but it also creates the risk that if we respond like we normally do, to the humanness, that need to connect, that becomes a danger. And that's a part of the tension that we face, and we deal with it by learning to prepare and by seeing how others are prepared and trained to handle it. Life has trained us for these challenges, just like our crews on the space station, we all can draw those lessons of our lives, and the strength we feel from each other. And that's what that key really relates to us.  Host: And I think we're all hoping for, you know, to learn a lot from this entire experience. And then maintain that positivity through this whole thing, and then of course on the back end, and continuing to keep it going. That is, right there, Dr. Williams, the CONNECT reminder, Community Openness, Networking Needs, Expeditionary Mindset, Counter Measures, and then lastly, Training and Preparation. Taking a whole snapshot of this whole thing, what does it really tell us about the impacts of social isolation and what we have to do to make sure that we are going to be OK when this is all over with?  Tom Williams: I think it really tells us a couple of really important things. One, we really learn from each other. We are social animals. We draw strength from each other. And with these opportunities to learn and strengthen one another, we all perform better, and the isolation confronts that in our lives. And we've got to be innovative, find ways to connect, so that we don't lose that ability to learn from each other, to draw strength from each other, and to feel more connected. So, when we're all together, it kind of, it really, social activity promotes long term health. That's so important. When we bring a sense of connection to our lives, and we connect with other people, we see that people who are more social, tend to live longer, they're healthier. So, we know that being socially isolated is going to impact on our mood, and it has health consequences. You know, so I made reference to this earlier, but our happiness really depends on the happiness of others with whom we're connected. So, we become happy, and happy, happiness is really connected and linked to our health. It's sort of a collective phenomenon. And happiness spreads. When we're happy, it can spread to other people. If you have a friend who's happy, it increases your probability by 25% of being happy, which is a British Medical Journal study that really looked at how happiness spreads from person to person. And so, if you have a next-door neighbor that's happy, that's 70% increase in probability. So, it really helps if you're the happy person you spread the happiness, you connect, you promote the health. We can't get together as we once did in the same ways, but we can certainly be together in different ways, and CONNECT helps us remember to do that. To have positive emotions, to be engaged, to focus on our relationships, define meaning in those relationships, and to look for ways as a social king to achieve things, just like we'd expect of our crew, to work towards some goal to make things better.  Host: I absolutely love that. Not only surrounding yourself with happy people, but ultimately becoming that champion of spreading happiness. What a wonderful thing to be discussing. I want to end on this note. You ended your thought on the, on our crews, on the space studies. I think what's really unique about this conversation is it's very, it's very relevant to all of our lives right now, living in a world of COVID-19, but a lot of the things that we're learning, a lot of the things that we're discussing, are things that were pulled from human spaceflight. Can you end with the value of conducting these studies, in space and, of course, on the analogues in the ground, and how important they are to understanding some of these concepts and bringing them into our own lives?  Tom Williams: Yeah. Thank you for that opportunity. Because these studies that we do, and they focus on the CONNECT, like we’ve just shared, really helps reinforce the importance of our human connections, that it's important that we look at how the team that we will send on a long duration space exploration mission, how they need to maintain the human connection with each other, and with us back on Earth. And it's important that we find ways to foster those connections with them, between them, among them, and with us. And that when we share danger, we share a special bond, and we know that there's a tension now, with that special bond, because we want to get together and we're in that tension. So, we pull this research from our analogues, we look at the isolation, we see the risk of becoming more socially narrowed and turning in, and that can be the reminder to reframe that, that tension that pulls us in, reframe it and reach out. Connect with others, be that positive, happy neighbor, that happy friend, and spread your good psychological benefit to others. And in doing so, they will spread it back to you.  Host: What a fascinating, enlightening, and then truly inspirational conversation we've had today. Dr. Tom Williams, thank you so much for returning to Houston We Have a Podcast. One of our valued guests we have, three-time returnee. I very much appreciated, having you on today.  Tom Williams: Thank you, so much.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 153, “Perseverance.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. NASA is paving the way towards a sustainable presence on the Moon and on to Mars. Though humans have never set foot on the red planet, we've been there many times. Most recently, the Mars InSight Lander that went to the surface of Mars to understand the planets quote unquote \"vital signs\", its seismology and heat flow and whether the planet's core is solid or liquid. Before that, the Curiosity Rover landed on Mars to explore the surface for chemical and mineral evidence of past habitable environments on Mars, searching for environments where microbes could have survived billions of years ago. Or these habitable environments. I remember watching Curiosity's landing live, and man, what a thrill. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is sending a new rover to Mars. It looks a lot like Curiosity but with a whole new suite of incredible instruments, many of which are in direct preparation for human exploration on Mars. We're talking instruments to test the production of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying valuable resources such as subsurface water, improving landing techniques, and characterizing Martian weather in a way that could help future astronauts that are living and working in the environment. So, here to go into detail on this new Mars 2020 rover called Perseverance is Luther Beegle, Deputy Division Manager for Science at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Luther is also the Principal Investigator of the [Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals] SHERLOC instrument, one of the scientific instruments on Perseverance. Note that this episode was recorded prior to the most recent change to the launch date of Perseverance. For the latest information please visit NASA.gov. So, here we go. The Mars Perseverance Rover with Luther Beegle. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Luther Beegle, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.  Luther Beegle: Thank you very much for having me. I really appreciate it.  Host: This is a very exciting topic. I love -- this is a very exciting mission, one of the top priorities for NASA this year, and it's coming up, you know, we're releasing this episode on July 17th, fingers crossed that we're still looking for that launch day. This is a big mission. I want to start, before we dive deep into Perseverance in this mission, I want to start with you, your interest in astrophysics. You have many degrees in astrophysics, and I want to understand kind of where that all began. Where did this spark, something that you wanted to dedicate your career to?  Luther Beegle: So, I think that, like most people, at least in my generation, basically “Star Wars” itself had a really big influence on me, not only from the perspective of entertainment, but from the perspective of what could possibly be out there. I watched science fiction movies in the past, and I think everybody had grown up wanting to be a spaceman. We've -- I've seen this -- I'm just old enough to remember one of the last Moon missions and watched movies about Mars and things like that. But when you start thinking about all of the permutations of what could possibly be out in the universe, it's really fascinating, and my interest went beyond just life. It went to what the stars are like and what the planets are like, but I always kept coming back to what was life like, and that's one of the reasons I am where I am.  Host: And that's got to be the genesis of why you pursued physics and astronomy first with a bachelor's, right? Physics is, I mean, I've heard it described as just like the language of the universe.  Luther Beegle: Yeah, and physics really is why things are the way they are, and a lot of it is problem solving, and I like problem solving. Physics, you're given an incomplete information, and you try to figure things out, and it really is -- it's very hard, very simple. All of electricity and magnetism really can be boiled down to four equations, Maxwell's equations, and then from there, you can build on everything else up there. And I always found that fascinating that there are things that you can, you know, figure things out with incomplete knowledge, and that was always fascinating from a problem-solving perspective. And it also fed into my interest in astrophysics and astrobiology later on, in that being a problem solver at heart, physics allows you to go into other things and try to solve problems in those fields as well. And it's -- it was a fascinating education.  Host: That's got to be where your interest in astrophysics, just understanding how the universe works, how that intersects with Mars, which is the -- really the topic of today is, is that's what this Perseverance rover is going to be doing. We want to understand more about Mars. So, how does that intersect here, your love of astrophysics and Mars?  Luther Beegle: So, Mars is the closest planet we have, and it's also the most Earth-like planet. So, we started thinking about where, you know, understanding of where we came from, you know, from an origin of life and origin of species perspective, Mars is it. Mars, we are close to it, we're able to access it, we're able to go down to the surface and touch it, we can see it, we know what it was like in the past, because you can see evidence all over the surface of different processes that happen. So, when you go thinking about looking for life, Mars is the first stepping stone of a lot of that, and it also enables us to try to start thinking for the first time of what actually is life-like and what -- how do we go look for it? Those are questions that have come up a lot over the past 30 years of my career that people have asked, and we continue to talk about them, and that's why Mars is special.  Host: That's a perfect lead into this next topic. You talk about there's evidence all over the surface of this, and it's worth noting that this is not the first time we're going to Mars. We've been to Mars, not exactly humans, but we've sent a lot of things to Mars to investigate that. Give us a brief history of what has been -- how we've gone to Mars in the past through various missions.  Luther Beegle: So, Mars is probably the most visited and really understood planet we have other than the Earth. Actually, it is the most visited and understood planet that we have behind the Earth. We've gone there since space age. We've looked at it through telescopes. You know, we've all heard the stories about the canals of Mars Percival Lowell and people like that, and we understand that we've been looking at Mars for, you know, hundreds of years and the ancients knew about it. We started sending spacecraft as soon as the space age started. We sent the Mariner spacecraft to Mars. We thought, we weren't exactly sure what we were going to see, and when we sent Mariner there, we found a cold dead planet. There wasn't life on it, like people would assume there would or there might be in the past, but Mariner did see things like dry riverbeds and other things that could only have been made through water processes. So, we started to figure out very quickly from Mariner, the Mariner series, that Mars at one point had to have liquid water on the surface, and now it was no longer possible. So, that brought Viking, and Viking was launched in 1976, and the Viking consisted of two landers and two orbiters, and what Viking did was Viking took a map of the planet, the orbiters took maps of the planets and the Viking orbiter -- Viking landers went down, landed on the surface, scooped up some material and tried to see if there was actual life associated with them. And we learned a lot from those experiments. We learned one, you really have to understand the geology and chemistry before you do a biology experiment, which was a big deal at the time. But we also learned how to operate in another planet, which was very important. And from there, there wasn't anything on Mars till about -- till 1996 when we launched Pathfinder, which was a small rover and a lander, [inaudible] station lander. That was the first time we've roved on another planet other than the Moon. Pathfinder went out and looked at a big dry rock to try to get the elemental abundance of that rock. From there, the 2003 mission, the MER, Mars Exploration Rover mission, which sent Spirit and Opportunity. These really were two feel robotic geologists, and what their job was, is their job was to go out and understand the geology of Mars. So, one of the things we've learned from Viking is, when the Viking tried to do the biology experiment, it came up with a result that we weren't 100% sure what to make of it. Some people thought it indicated that there was life there. The vast majority of people thought it was just a chemical reaction, but what we learned was is that we had to really understand geology and to understand chemistry in order to understand biology. And so, Spirit and Opportunity were two missions that went there to two different locations and started looking at the geology, let's understand the geology, and what they found was they found a planet. They found minerals, and they found environments that were aqueous in nature, so that there was liquid water at both those landing sites at some time in the past, and that's important, because now we know that Mars, you know, we can see different places on Mars that all have the same aqueous process associated with it. We sent Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2005. That was taking high resolution images of the planet and did some spectroscopy of the planet as well, so we can understand from orbit where different mineral deposits were. We've sent [Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution] MAVEN, that was a scout mission, and InSight, they were two smaller class missions to look for whether Mars had earthquakes. That was InSight. MAVEN looked at -- was looking at the atmosphere, trying to understand what happened to the atmosphere. We know Mars' atmosphere now does -- can't support liquid water on the surface, but we know in the past it had liquid water on the surface. So, what MAVEN did was MAVEN tried to figure out what happened to that atmosphere and what were the processes that moved forward with that, which was really cool. And then Curiosity, which was the biggest rover we'd sent to date in two-thousa… it landed in 2012, and that really was looking at chemistry and looking for organic molecules and trying to determine whether the planet was habitable in the past, and by that we mean whether or not the condition existed on the surface of Mars that life as we know it could exist. And Curiosity has found that at Gale Crater, and that's pretty much the history. So, that leaves us to Perseverance, which is going to go to basically look for potential bio signatures and try to cache samples to return to Earth later on.  Host: Yeah, that's a huge milestone of -- and a difference really with Perseverance. You went through this beautiful history of all these different rovers and landers and orbiters. I mean, we've been sending all these crazy instruments to really, as you said, this is the most studied planet other than Earth, and you can see why. I mean, we're looking at all these different elements that are really diving deep into the history of how this planet works, what's on it, the history of it. It's absolutely fascinating, and it sounds like Perseverance is just taking those next steps.  Luther Beegle: Yeah. If you look, there's been a thought process for the whole program, right? It's not just let's go send a biology mission and a very complicated biology mission, but it's -- we're going to build blocks, we're going to understand this, we're going to understand that, we're going to understand, you know, geology and chemistry, then understand the internal dynamics of the planet, understand some of the history of the planet, and we build along the way. So, it's a -- and we look at different sites along the way as well. So, what happens is, is that you start adding all of these things together, and then what you're left with is you're left with a really interesting -- history of the planet and a better understanding of the planet.  Host: Wonderful. Well, let's dive into Perseverance, because you ended it when you were going through this history of the different orbiters, land rovers, all those, you talked about Curiosity. I understand a lot of Perseverance is modeled after Curiosity. In fact, if you look at pictures of the two of them, they look very similar.  Luther Beegle: They do. [Mars Science Laboratory] MSL, Mars Curiosity is a rover that's about 900 kilograms. It's about the size of a Mini Cooper. It has a scientific payload that's very complex. Perseverance is more complex than Curiosity in several ways, but it's built on this. The nuts and bolts and skeletons are the same from Perseverance as they are on Curiosity. So, whenever we go do a new mission, we have to learn from scratch how to do a lot of things. For example, you know, wheels, how the wheels work, how tools interact, how the robotic arm interacts. So, what we did with Perseverance is we took all of the stuff we learned from MSL and all of the stuff we learned from MER and added to it to make a more complex mission. But we used the same type of skeleton to actually do this. So, from the outside, it looks the same. It has six wheels; the wheels are very large. I think they're 65 centimeters in diameter. It has a robotic arm. It has a mask -- the kind of the mask looks kind of the same, the robotic arm kind of looks the same, except it's much more complicated. So, our robotic arm on Perseverance is much bigger than the robotic arm, and it's much more capable than the robotic arm on MSL, but we had to learn how to do all of that with MSL, so that we can do go to the next step and learn on what we're doing on Perseverance. The other thing Perseverance has that MSL did not have is we have the capability of caching samples. So, the robotic arm has a core on it, and that core will go out to different spots that we decide to pick depending on the diversity of sites and things like that and how much scientifically interesting the sample has or sample is, and we will basically be able to capture some of that sample, put it in the tube, seal that tube up, and then basically go back and pick it up later with a different mission. And so, Perseverance does the science, my instrument SHERLOC, [Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry] PIXL, SuperCam, Mastcam-Z, RIMFAX, and [Mars Oxygen in-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment] MOXIE and MEDA. We all are doing great science to characterize the sample, and then we're going to be able to bring that sample back. So, that's the next step in Mars' exploration is the sample return aspect of this particular mission.  Host: That's perfect. That's one of the new objectives of Perseverance, but what I'm hearing with this skeleton, the framework that you were talking about, it sounds like it's just -- what Curiosity did beyond its own scientific missions was prove that the hardware was right. It had to deal with maybe a sense of that this technology -- the way that you rove across the surface of Mars was proven, and then you just take the different scientific instruments and objectives you want to do and rove across the Martian surface, just doing -- meeting those objectives. Is that the idea?  Luther Beegle: That is the idea, and what happens is, is that you have -- it's a learning process the entire way. You had to learn to walk before you could run, you had to run before you could fly, and that's exactly what we're doing here. The -- I used to work on Curiosity, and I was part of the, we called ourselves the Surface Sampling System Scientists, and what we did is we tried to figure out whether it was possible to drill on Mars and what type of materials could you drill into and could you not drill into, because this is all stuff we've done for the very first time, and that is really scary. If you send something to Mars, if it breaks, it breaks. There's no way to fix it. There's nobody -- tape duct tape for the spacecraft we used to joke about all the time that could just basically tape themselves off, fix the hardware and just basically go back on. You're stuck with what you have, and so you're really trying to figure things out along the way and by learning all of these things, learning how the rover operates in this particular environment, the sand environment versus a rock environment, now we understand all of that we can design things better. One of the things that MSL did do is we had a wheel issue. At a certain point, we realized that the wheels were degrading faster than they were designed to. So, we learned from that, and Perseverance has a new set of wheels, and you could only do that by in situ the testing of that. We understood how the robotic arm placement can be, so how we put a drill down, what if the drill interacts with the rest of the rover in a bad way? So, now we can do a core, which is a more complicated piece of equipment. So, you keep learning along the way, and you keep becoming more and more sophisticated. I think that MSL was the most complicated mission ever flown, robotic mission ever flown, and Perseverance is more complicated than that. So, we keep adding and we keep getting better, which is what we at NASA tend to want to do is always do is always push the envelope.  Host: That's incredible. Yeah, there's been a lot of strides in that, and I can totally see the logic of wanting to -- you -- it's the ultimate test, right? Those wheels on Mars is the ultimate test for the wheels. You learn from them, and you make them better for the next mission. It's perfect. Talk about some of the just general design features of, I guess, a little bit of Curiosity, a little bit of Perseverance, things that make this the right type of rover. I know, I know, just, you know, and I was really into Curiosity in 2012 with landing it was just such a such a big event for me, and I was really fascinated by the wheels and just this tradeoff of torque and speed and wanting to get over some of those rocks and stuff like, so some of those engineering-like design elements of how Perseverance will do the roving on Mars.  Luther Beegle: So, the way Perseverance is going to do it is much like Curiosity did with some added exceptions, which I'm not 100% sure are actually going to work, not work, but be implemented, because working is a different concept. We have the large wheels and what the large wheels will enable you to do is not worry about the number of really reducing the number of hazards in a particular site. As you get closer to the ground, bigger rocks become problematic. If anybody's ever driven a Jeep versus a car that's very low to the ground, you'll know that if you go over a speed bump, you kind of sometimes scrape against the ground. By having the bigger wheels than MER did, you're able to go over a lot more of those particular rocks and not have to worry about them. They become less of a problem. We've learned on Curiosity we had problems -- gap of getting over sand, getting up and over a sand patch. So, we kind of understand that we can't get over that. Those wheels, we learned how to drive backwards with the same wheels on MSL that we will learn on Curiosity, I mean, excuse me, Perseverance. The wheels themselves will go actually very relatively slow. I don't -- I'm not sure what the speed limit is, but we end up going on Curiosity 80 to 100 meters a day, I think, as an average is a good day for Curiosity. And hopefully, we'll be able to push that a little bit on Perseverance. We have a proven landing system on Perseverance. We're using the Sky Crane, exact same design as we used on Curiosity. Hopefully, that will enable us to get to within a smaller and smaller place of where we want to go on the ground. So, what happens is, is that the original landing systems were -- it had a landing ellipse, which is basically where you land that were very large, hundreds of kilometers. We've now lowered that down into the tens of kilometers range, because the landing systems have become better and better and better, and if you're going to send humans, you really need to even reduce that even further. But the landing system now has enabled us to go to Jezero Crater, which we would not have been able to go under old landing systems, because it's too hazardous, but we've reduced the error, the where we can land greatly. You -- and we use a lot of the same parts to do that. It's been -- the design is solid and been tested. So, it enabled us to take a little, you know, go do things that we haven't been able to do before.  Host: So, this is, just to confirm, this is the same landing system, but it sounds like was there a few upgrades to make it a little bit more precise too?  Luther Beegle: There is a different feature on this landing system called terrain navigation.  Host: Cool.  Luther Beegle: And so, what we're able to do is we're able to, when we hit, when we go down through and we're in the final stage of descent, the rover has onboard images of what the landing ellipse looks like, and it can tell whether it's in a spot where this might not be the best place to land on, so let's move over a little bit. And that's a new feature with this rover that we didn't have on the last one. The last one, we, you know, we could go down and then lower everything down to the surface and landing on all four wheels or six wheels and just move off. This one allows us to go to a spot that we wouldn't have been able to go. Because we have the terrain, we're able to avoid terrain that we can't get to in the past. The [Entry, Descent and Landing] EDL system operates -- you're going 17 -- it's about 17,000 miles an hour when you hit the top of the atmosphere, and seven minutes later you've got to be going zero miles an hour. There's a great video online of describing this all called the “7 Minutes of Terror” that describes the entire EDL system, and it's all automated, and it happens all -- we just turn it on, and we let it go. And we find out whether or not we landed or not, but it's the Sky Crane configuration. We hit the top of the atmosphere going 17,000 miles an hour, and there's a heat shield. That heat shield dissipates heat in the atmosphere. It slows us down to, I'm not sure what the miles an hour is, but we then lose the heat shield, and we open up a parachute. That's a supersonic parachute. It's a very large parachute, which then dumps more energy, we slow down even further, but we get to about a couple of kilometers above the surface, and then we're on retrorockets. So, the landing system itself takes over this active landing system, and the Sky Crane itself, it's kind of like a landing system, and it's all over the rover, and basically, the rover gets lowered to the ground by a rope, and then the rover hits the ground and then moves off on its own power. It's really cool to watch. It's a really cool video to see how it all works.  Host: I loved that video, “7 Minutes of Terror,” especially back in 2012, when I was following Curiosity, I watched that over and over and over. It was just fascinating. Is this landing system the one you're describing for Perseverance? Are there elements of this, because I know when I was reading the description of Perseverance and some of its objectives, one of the things was improving the techniques for landing? Is this one of those things that might actually help us -- the landing of Perseverance might actually help us understand how eventually to land humans on Mars?  Luther Beegle: The answer to that question is I don't really know. I do know what it does do is it's completely instrumented, and so it understands the nature of the Martian atmosphere better, and by that we can design better landing systems. I think there's probably an upper limit to how much this landing system can land. In fact, I know there is, because I've read some of the mission architectures for potential humans to Mars, and so they all have different landing systems associated with it, but giving -- this gives us information on what that atmosphere is like in the higher -- above the surface, and so we can get -- take that information and design better systems, and that's the important part of the EDL system for potential humans to Mars. I don't know whether or not the scales to full human activities, and that's a lot more mass.  Host: Yeah, no, yeah, sure, not necessarily designed, but understanding what the environment is that you're dealing with, that's got to help for sure.  Luther Beegle: Yeah, it does, and, in fact, it basically flows all into that, and we, every time we land, we learn something new, and it's good.  Host: Perfect. You mentioned some supersonic parachutes. There's a lot of crazy engineering that's going into the landing here, and I know just from Curiosity, a lot of it is familiar to me, but for Perseverance specifically, some of the development of testing of some of those things to make sure Perseverance is going to survive the journey.   Luther Beegle: Yeah, testing is we joke all the time that testing is always nerve-racking, because you've spent four years building something, and then all of a sudden, you go in to test it, and you just hope that it works the way everything is supposed to work, because it's put the -- it really puts the needle to the test. There's better act -- there's a better description than that. So, what happens is that we have to test everything, and so if you remember back to when I was talking about what the Mars Exploration Rovers, everybody talks about the fact they were only supposed to exist for 90 days. But really, what that means is, is that all of the instruments and all of the hardware was -- were tested out to about three times life. So, we test, we test, we test, we test, and we test for three times what the eventual life is going to be. We don't test things till they die. We test things to make sure that they work for three times what the nominal lifetime is, and what that means is that Mars is a very difficult place. Mars, every day on Mars, the temperature swings are about 100 degrees centigrade, which is about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. So, imagine going from ice freezing to boiling, freezing to boiling, freezing to boiling every single day, and all of the hardware has to work through those environments. It's also a very, very dusty place. It's very -- there's -- dust gets into everything. You can see pictures of Curiosity now, and I have one in my office where there's dust just littered across the deck of everything there. It's also got a very low atmospheric pressure, which change -- which adds some complexity to things like high voltage and other things that we try to do. So, what happens is you make the hardware, you put it in through these tests, the hardware has to go through these [inaudible] cycles, basically zero to, you know, from zero to minus 100, zero to minus 100. It's got to go through 3,000 cycles of that, and it's got to work, and it's got to work every single time, and it's -- everything has to -- and everything is tested under relevant Martian conditions. It's -- principle here called test as you fly, and so we've tested our hardware down to minus 110 degrees -- SHERLOC hardware down to minus 110 degrees. We've tested it up to 50 degrees C, because when it's flying in space and it's flying in that – the that, that heating, the backshell, it does get -- it gets much hotter than it ever will on the surface, but you have to make sure that the instrument can survive those conditions as well. So, it's test, test, test to make sure that you take everything that Mars can and throw at you and continue to make sure that everything works that way. It also has to go undergo shock and vibe that, you know, in the launch conditions, everything gets shaken up during launch. There's a shock when it hits the atmosphere. So, everything gets, you know, really hit hard with a shock and every -- all hardware has to work through all of those conditions, and you continue to test, and you just, you know, you go into a test and you just pray, and you pray, and you pray, and it's funny, because then sometimes when things don't work, you have to figure, you have to go back and figure out why it didn't work, whether it was a problem with the test setup, whether it was a problem with the test design, whether it was a problem with the hardware, and then you've got to redesign the hardware to make sure that it works in those particular tests. And it's nerve racking, it's very nerve racking, because you're going to be working on hardware for four years, and you put it through a test and it doesn't function the way it's supposed to function, and all of a sudden you're like, wow, we're back at, you know, we're not back at square one, but, you know, god, how do I fix this?  Host: So, we're recording this in the middle of June now. Perseverance, I'm guessing, at this point made it through the wringer, survived all the tests?  Luther Beegle: Everything seems to survive. We did the thermal test here. We have a big, you know, these things go into big giant chambers. We take them -- we take the whole thing down to minus 100 degrees. We pump all the atmosphere out. We see what's going to happen. We test it on different rocks and things like that, and everything passed, it's at the Cape right now. It's all -- it should be all buttoned up here shortly and getting ready to be put on the rocket to be launched, and it's a very exciting time. But I, you know, we talked about the “7 Minutes of Terror,” and it's funny, because when we were landing Opportunity, I mean, excuse me, Curiosity, one of the other engineers looked at me and said, “you know, I've been working on Curiosity for seven years, so they should really do a seven years of terror,” I just don't believe that the video would be all that interesting, I'm just sitting around just panicking of all the things that could go wrong. And everything, you know, we think about everything that could go wrong for multiple times, so.  Host: Yeah, that'd be a long one to watch for sure.  Luther Beegle: Yeah, it's not very interesting.  Host: Yeah. So, you talked about designing it, you know, when you're talking about mission duration, you know, you talked about the Mars Exploration Rovers being designed for 90 days, I think it was like, you know, designing for three times the -- I forget the phrasing exactly what you said. But I know the Perseverance is tested for one Martian year, 687 Earth days. Does that mean you tested it to make sure that it's going to survive 387 Earth days at a minimum?  Luther Beegle: Yeah, no. So, if it's six -- if it's 90 days, we test it for 270 days.  Host: Got it.  Luther Beegle: For Perseverance, it was close 700 days, so we test it for 2,100 days.  Host: That's a lot of testing.  Luther Beegle: Yeah, it is a lot of testing.  Host: For sure.  Luther Beegle: And there's a lot of worries, because every single one of those testing cycles you're worried about what's going to happen, but it's good engineering, and it's very good engineering practices. Not everything can be tested that way, because there are some things that are considered consumables, but so you have to really figure out what's going on and make sure that you've thought of everything in those cases, and then you get waivers and get reviewed, but you -- they take a really fine look at anything that doesn't get tested for the 2,100 days on Perseverance.  Host: Very cool. So, before we go into the science, I did want to tackle the mission profile here for a second. Right now, we're in the middle of June. It's scheduled for a July 17th launch date. I know that there are constraints with making sure that Earth and Mars are aligned. So, July 17th, I'm assuming, was picked for a very specific reason.  Luther Beegle: It is. So, actually, I think as of this morning, the earliest launch is now the 20th. I think we've slipped three days because of an issue with the Cape, however, yeah, so what happens is that Mars and Earth are continually moving. And so, what you're doing is you're launching from Earth to Mars, they have to be in the right state in their orbits. So, you can only launch to Mars about every 26 months. So, there's about a three to four-week period where that launch window opens depending on where exactly they are in the orbits. And so, you launch and your -- the spacecraft itself, basically at Mars get to the same point at the same time, because it takes, you know, seven months for it to -- seven to nine months for it to get there. So, Mars and that's -- so there's a launch window where it opens up. As you saw on the 17th of July, and it ends like the first week in August. We are going to land, however, at the -- at -- on February 18th at a certain time, and you can plan that exactly, and you need to plan that exactly, because there's a lot of orbital assets with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MRO, Mars Odyssey still, MAVEN, that will be taking measurements as the spacecraft is going in. And you need all of those orbital assets to be in the correct spot at the correct time, so you know exactly when it's going to land, but you get like three to four weeks of when it can possibly launch.  Host: Got it, okay. So, that's -- we're still within the window. We've, at this time, we've slipped through the 20th, but we're still within that window. It is -- you mentioned the Cape. We are launching from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station down in Florida. It's going to be launching on a ULA Atlas V-541 rocket. It is going to be -- well, actually, before I get to the landing site, I did want to ask about the profile of how it gets there. I mean, I don't know if it does a couple orbits around the Earth before a Trans-Mars injection or if there's anything fancy in between.  Luther Beegle: No, it's a direct injection.  Host: Got it.  Luther Beegle: Type two or type three orbit. It just goes straight out from the Earth and straight into Mars.  Host: Perfect. Now, the landing site, you've already mentioned this before, was Jezero Crater, and you said that Jezero Crater is a bit more hazardous, but this new landing system is able to get us to this area. What's so interesting and actually what's so hazardous about Jezero Crater?  Luther Beegle: So, Jezero Crater, where we're going to land is, we're going to land really at the base of what looks like a river delta, and on all indications, it was a river delta. So, Jezero Crater is a crater in -- near Northeast [inaudible] on Mars. And it's -- there's ample evidence that there was liquid water in this crater. In fact, you can see the one riverbed come in. It's got a beautiful delta, you know, dried up delta, where -- at the base we're going to land, and then at the other side of the crater, there's a place where the water used to go out into another basin. So, we know that there was water, we know water came in, we know water was there for a while, and we know it flowed out. So, this is a really cool place to go look for life. Now the reason why it's a little bit hazardous is that river deltas do have, you know, structure to them. So, you don't want to land on the side of a cliff. You want to land on a nice flat surface, and so because we have the terrain navigation feature, we can move away from the cliffs and actually land on a flat surface, and we have that ability. And so, Jezero was -- it's really cool. It's got a lot of mineral diversity as well. So, there's a lot of different things on the bottom of the crater that we can go look at, and really, what we want to do is we want to get a -- sample return and understanding what Mars was like in the past. We want to get a lot of diversity. We really don't, you know, you think about how far we've actually driven on Mars and how far we've actually explored. We've sent a lot of spacecraft there, and we've spent a lot of missions there, but the longest mission that's ever been there is 28 miles, and that's the Opportunity. It drove 28 miles. Curiosity was up to 13 or 14 miles as of last summer. So, the total mileage that we've driven across the surface of Mars is only 50 miles, and, you know, you can only really go out and touch a couple meters on each side of the rover. So, if you think about that, if you think about what the Earth is like and the diversity of different places on the Earth, you need to get out and try different things that the Sahara Desert is much different than the Amazon, which is much different than Siberia, which is even different than the Mojave here in Los Angeles. And 50 miles is not even half the distance between, you know, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, for example. So, it's really looking at diverse sites, looking at different places in Mars, trying to figure out all of Mars history, and that's really what we want to do. So, Jezero Crater has a lot of that stuff, and that's why we're going there.  Host: Yeah. You know, it's funny you say 50 miles. My commute to and from work is more than 50 miles. So, to put it in perspective, the total amount of area we've covered on Mars is less than my daily commute. That's definitely saying something, but even what you're saying about Jezera Crater and the, you know, why we're landing there and what is there, from a scientific perspective, that sounds so exciting.  Luther Beegle: Yeah, if there was a place on Mars that had ancient life, this is one of -- this would be one of the, you know, places that you would actually go look if there's -- there's evidence of hydrothermal activity on the floor of the crater, the fact that there's water coming from different spots along the way. We like chemical gradients for life. We enjoy things, and we enjoy looking for things like that, and that's really, really what makes Jezero a really fascinating place to go. And it's going to be really interesting, and what's really cool is that when we land, we -- the plan is to go up to the delta. So, we'll basically be going back in time, because the stuff or the rock will be younger than the stuff at the bottom. And so, we'll go through different epochs of Mars, and eventually, we're going to head to a place called Northeast [inaudible], which has a lot of really cool formations and mineralogy as well that we've seen from [Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars] CRISM and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It's a fascinating diverse place that we do a lot of really good scientific papers and understanding better of what Mars was like when it had water.  Host: For sure, so exciting. That's just, that whole mission profile, you just want to follow along every step of the way and see what's discovered along the way.  Luther Beegle: Yeah.  Host: Let's get into the science, let's get into the fun stuff. You've already said one of the objectives here for the scientific objectives, seek signs of ancient life, that seems to be one of the top ones.  Luther Beegle: Yeah, and that's -- it's an interesting concept, seeking signs of ancient life. What we say a lot is we're going to look for potential bio signatures, and we use these words very carefully. It's very difficult. It's easy to discover alien life if it looks like E.T. or Chewbacca or, you know, the aliens from Independence Day. That's easy to see. What we expect Mars to have had is microbial life, and if it had microbial life, and it flourished on the surface, it was three, four billion years ago, when Mars had liquid water. If there's life on the surface now, near surface, it's exceedingly rare, and it would be very difficult to find. And when we look at what happened on the Earth in terms of ancient life and our understanding of what the Earth is like, there's still a lot of arguments on when we go to different formations. For example, the Australian pool formation -- in Australia, there's evidence of 3.5-billion-year-old life and some other places, and there's a lot of scientific debate on whether or not these are really bio signatures or whether they weren't created by life or not, and we know life exists on the Earth. We don't know that about Mars. So, we continue to say potential bio signatures, because we want to make sure that if we see something, we study it and we know that it was basically biotic in nature. And so, we want to go seek things that we look at and we go, well, that's really fascinating, it's very difficult to make that without bio -- without bugs, without microbes doing the work, let's bring that sample back to Earth and analyze it in the laboratory and analyze it with as much, with as many instruments as we possibly can to determine whether or not that was alive and get scientific consensus on that.  Host: So, what, sorry--  Luther Beegle: That's really powerful.  Host: Yeah, yeah, I was going to ask, I was going to follow up with some of the instruments onboard Perseverance. What's onboard Perseverance? What kinds of instruments to look for some of these bio signatures?  Luther Beegle: So, we have a few instruments on Perseverance that are not necessarily doing the biology part of it, but the potential bio signatures detection part of it, but they're doing very valuable scientific research, because, like I said, before, you need to understand the geology of the site. You need to understand the chemistry of the site. You need to understand everything about it to understand the bigger picture, and so we have a few -- we have the one instrument is RIMFAX, which is a ground-penetrating radar. It'll let us know what's in the subsurface. So, that'll give us an idea of what this -- what the history of this particular site was, because we'll see structure in the subsurface that we've never seen before. So, as we're moving along, where, in fact, it looks down and understands what's going on in the subsurface. We have MEDA, which does -- is the metric -- meteorological station. It does temperature and pressure and wind speed and wind direction to understand the climate of Mars. So, we can understand better what's going on in the whole surface of Mars. And then beyond that, we have Mastcam-Z, which is twin imagers on top of the mast that can look out, and it'll pick -- takes the great pictures of panorama where we are, you know, being able to see geologic features and understand where we are. We'll be able to get a great picture of the -- where we are at the base of the Delta. We have Mastcam SuperCam, which is a remote Raman spectrometer, lid spectrometer, and IR spectrometer, and it'll tell us in the distance what's the mineralogy like of the site where it -- is that mineral, for example, is that rock over there, is that an aqueous rock, because it only could've formed under water, or is that rock basaltic, could it only have formed through a volcanic process and things like that. So, that'll help us understand the entire site, and then we have two instruments on the arm, PIXL and SHERLOC. PIXL is a microscopic elemental abundance mapper. So, what it does is it looks at the elements in a particular sample, so we can tell the history of that sample a lot better. It can identify some potential bio signatures because of life-like certain elements over certain other elements, and then we have SHERLOC, which is on the Principal Investigator of, which then will go in and look for organic molecule distribution. It is an instrument on the robotic arm too. We'll be able to look for organics. We're going to look for minerals, but more importantly, than just looking for them, we'll be able to put them in context. So, it will take an image, we'll take a picture, and then we'll be able to tell whether or not there's layers of organics or there's layers of minerals, and that helps us a lot understand the history of that sample. And all of these, all of these instruments together, because there's so many imagers onboard, we can look at all of these results we're getting back from the same sample and with multiple instruments, and that tells us a lot more about a sample than we would with just looking at one instrument at a time. And the last instrument that I haven't mentioned yet is an instrument called MOXIE, which is a precursor for a In Situ Resource Utilization, ISRU instrument, which is going to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and it's going to take that carbon dioxide and make oxygen out of it. And what that is going to show is we're going to show for the first time that we have a -- the ability to make rocket fuel, which is, oxygen is part of rocket fuel, and whether we can make something that the astronauts can actually breathe in when we get to the surface, and that's really cool. That's one of the of us sending humans there, and the last thing that I haven't talked about is the helicopter, which is the first time we're going to try a -- quadcopter on the surface of Mars. It's a tech demonstration, and so we're going to see how that works in the first 60 or 90 sols on the Red Planet, and that's going to be able to take off, fly for a couple minutes, take images, and then relay it back to the rover. And eventually, that'll lead to a better way of roving around the red planet, but all of these instruments operating together is fascinating. This really is a payload that's been thought out in terms of these -- in terms of identifying bio signatures and what could potentially be a bio signature, what potentially can't be a bio signature.  Host: And it sounds like it even goes beyond that, you know, potential bio signatures. It sounds like it's understanding the environment. There's -- you talked about the MEDA instrument, understanding, you know, what's going on with the weather and the dust. I love the aspect of human exploration and In-Situ Resource Utilization, that's going to be huge. A precursor mission, sure, but that's a that's a huge step towards humans living and working on Mars. That's big one.  Luther Beegle: Yeah and living off the land is really important. If you're going to send humans, you can't send everything with them. It's way too volumetric, and it becomes very costly relatively quickly, but yeah, you -- what we learned from Viking really was that you need a better understanding of everything to really understand what the biology is like. MEDA does a lot more things than just understanding the wind and everything else. We can look at the humidity levels, whether it's changing with time, whether something from the subsurface might be, you know, influencing what's going on in the near surface climate. That's really huge. Understanding the amount of UV radiation, they'll be able to measure that to a very precise level, and that goes back into what the chemistry is on the surface. So, you know, everything acts together, and we're, you know, all of the payload elements works in a really good solid team, and what we can do, you know, is -- SHERLOC does -- adds onto what PIXL can do, which adds on to what SuperCam can do. And you get a lot more information when you're looking at something with multiple instruments, which is why sample return is so fascinating. So, when you send something to Mars, you know, you've got -- you send it, you design your instrument four, five years before you send it, and you -- plan on what you're going to go see. But you're never 100% sure what you're actually going to get when you get there, because if we knew what we were going to find, we wouldn't send anything in the first place, because, you know, that would be dull and boring. But by finding -- but by going out there and doing the exploration is when you see something, you know, most scientific -- most great science discoveries are always, you know, you just never eureka, it's wow, that's really weird, let's, what is that? What is -- what's going on there? And so, having all these instruments together enables us to do that, and what's going to happen is we're going to find something that looks kind of live, that might be alive, that we're going to be able to capture that particular sample. We'll seal it up, we'll bring it back, and then we'll use every instrument on Earth to look at that particular sample and then come to a scientific consensus, “hey, Mars did have life or no, there was no life associated with that,” and that's the power of sample return. And we have a well characterized sample, which is even more important. It's not just a random piece of Mars that just ended up in Antarctica, because we find pieces of Mars all the time in Antarctica, but this is a well-characterized not transformed sample that should revolutionize what we think of Mars and Mars history.  Host: This is fascinating. There are so many interesting instruments onboard looking at all these different aspects but man, that sample return is so exciting. It just makes you want to just let's go to Mars and pick that thing up and bring it back, you know? I'm sure there's like a ton of scientists that want to get their hands on that first, you know, sample return from Mars. That's -- that'll be a big deal.  Luther Beegle: Yeah, it will be, and, you know, the funny thing is, depending on who I'm talking to, I get very excited about either the in-situ science. This is the first time. The in-situ science on this is fascinating as well.  Host: Yeah.  Luther Beegle: It's the first time we're actually looking at microscopic type samples on Mars. So, we have the ability on SHERLOC. We're looking for organics and minerals in 100 micron, that's the size of the human hair, scale, and what we're doing is we're able to take those -- that data, and we're able to look at a postage-sized stamp. So, we're looking at every 100 microns, we're looking at something that, you know, we'll be able to map out and be able to look at a sample and say, look, there's layering in a sample, and this particular organic matches with this particular mineral, and that's fascinating. How could those have existed at the exact same time? And then we'll take PIXL data on that particular sample and say, look that elemental abundance, elements abundance is really, really strange, I think that only biology could have done that, we're definitely going to take this sample back, and we will learn a bunch of stuff on the surface. The science will be great on the surface, and then we'll go take it another step by taking the samples back and then doing even more stuff with them on Earth. And that's where all of the power comes in, because the more things -- the more time -- the more instruments you can look at a sample, the more you learn about that sample, the more you learn about history, and it just, it takes everything we want out of a mission and put – ties a nice big bow around it.  Host: Well, this is this is actually a perfect place to wrap up, because, you know, you talk about, you talk about all these things that we're looking forward to learning. We started this conversation with thinking about all the different ways we visited Mars in the past, through all of these different missions, you know? I'm sure there's folks out there thinking like, you know, why are we -- why do we keep going back to Mars? What is there that's so interesting about Mars that we need to go back and back and back and back? What would be your response to someone who's asking that question, why it's so important to go back and continue to learn new things?  Luther Beegle: It's a great question, and the answer is, we know Mars had everything we needed, that is needed for life to begin back at the same time life started on the Earth. It had liquid water. It had energy sources in terms of both solar radiation and hydrothermal and volcanic activity and chemical energy on the surface, and it had organic molecules. We know all three of those things. So, the big question is, did life start on Mars, and if it didn't, why didn't it start on Mars? We've lost a lot of information on Earth on the conditions that we're like back when Earth -- when life started on Earth, because we have plate tectonics. Rocks get -- rocks come and go, rocks get destroyed, they get remade. There's not a lot of evidence of rocks that are 3.6 billion years old. Mars has no plate tectonics. So, Mars, the conditions of Mars, 3.6 billion years ago, have only undergone chemical alteration, not geologic alteration. So, if life started on Mars, that's fascinating. If life didn't start on Mars, that's fascinating as well, because we might be able to figure out what was different and what stopped life from starting on Mars or what created life on Mars. Either way, it's a fascinating answer, and the last thing is that, because Mars was like Earth and Venus probably was like Earth at one point, and it's long in the past. Now, Venus is way, way too hot, and Mars is way, way too cold, and Earth is perfect. So, we've got three planets, all started in the same spot in the solar system relatively. One is too hot, one is too cold, one is just right. So, when we look out, we look at all of the exoplanets that we found, and we're up to about 5,000 exoplanets, the question is, how many of those could possibly have life associated with them? In order to make that calculation, we really have to understand what's the difference between Venus, Mars, and Earth, and this mission will help do that. This mission will help understand why Mars is different and what the differences are and what makes it important and what doesn't make it important? Is life easy to start or is life hard to start? Either way, it's a fascinating answer, and it really does tell us a lot about where we are and where we've come from and where we're heading.  Host: That's beautiful. You know, there's probably so many and, there has to be so many people that you're working with on a day to day basis, all contributing to Perseverance, yes, but to many other missions to Mars and truly believe all of these things. They have this passion, that, the same passion that I'm hearing from you about exploring Mars and understanding that, just, you know, what is it like working with the team at JPL and with all these PIs that are contributing and wanting to learn about Mars and that passion that exists in this community?  Luther Beegle: So, we -- there are probably, I don't know, 1,000 people that have worked either directly or indirectly on Perseverance, not just at JPL. We have Co-Is at JSC, we have Co-Is at [inaudible], we have Co-Is at Goddard. There are people all over the country that are working on this particular thing, but it is fascinating. And it's not -- at JPL, we just don't think about Mars. We talk about how Mars is different than Europa, which is a satellite of Jupiter that has more water on it, liquid water than the Earth does. Is life there? Is life on Enceladus? So, we'll talk about these things all the time, and it's a fascinating place to be, because you can start asking questions that every -- normal people look at you like you're insane when you ask, but you're like, well, no, no, that's what Titan is like, you know, little hydrocarbon lakes of, you know, bubbly benzene and other things, and it's 90 degrees Kelvin. Could life exist there, could life exist there, and you start thinking about these things in terms of all these different conditions, and there are some great conversations to be had and then great philosophical discussions. The, you know, going back to the Mars question, if Mars didn't have life, that's pretty big. If Mars did have life, that's pretty big as well, and either way, you start figuring these things out, and you start thinking about what does this mean for us as a species? And it's great, and the teamwork is also great. I can't -- on SHERLOC itself, we had, you know, 50 to 100 people working on it for all of our Co-Is and external partners, and every single one brings this really quite enthusiasm to the team, and it really worked as a great team. And I know that the other instruments feel the same way and other portions of the rope have felt the same way, like there were hundreds of different companies that contributed to the design and build of this in different states and different places, and you can always -- you can -- you call them up and you start talking to them, you realize how proud they are being able to help do this, and it's a great experience.  Host: Well, Luther I'm sure a lot of people are feeling pride just even listening to you describe all the different contributions, and honestly, I, you know, I just wish the best to all the team that contributed so many different parts to this mission, whether the engineering, whether the science, and there's just a lot to look forward to, and to you Luther, I really, you know, best of luck to you and to the SHERLOC team, and I really appreciate your time for coming on the podcast and explaining this fascinating rover and everything on it. It's been super fun. I really appreciate your time.  Luther Beegle: I really appreciate being here. Anytime, any chance we get to talk about it is great, because it really helps us get enthusiastic about, you know, about doing the day to day job, because it's fascinating to bring to the public.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 264, “NACHO Average Experiment.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Today we'll be talking about NACHOS. No, not that. It's, unsurprisingly, an acronym, that stands for Nanosatellite Atmospheric Chemistry Hyperspectral Observation System. This instrument could make it easier to monitor volcanic activity and air quality in cities, neighborhoods, and power plants here on Earth on a much smaller scale than what's previously been measured. NACHOS launched earlier this year on Northrop Grumman's 17th resupply mission to the International Space Station to monitor atmospheric trace gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. NACHOS has since been deployed from the International Space Station into a one-year journey in low-Earth orbit, and in fact they were able to launch another NACHOS CubeSat into orbit. So, to discuss the NACHO[S] experiment, we have NACHOS principal investigator, researcher, and task lead with the Space and Remote Sensing Group at the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, Steve Love. Steve received a bachelor's degree in physics from Washington State University, where he then went on to earn his Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1991. He joined Los Alamos National Lab immediately thereafter. Since 1994 Steve has worked in the laboratory’s Space and Remote Sensing group, where his primary focus has been the development of new techniques and instrumentation for optical remote sensing and imaging spectroscopy. With that, if you're hungry, grab a plate of nachos, and let's talk about NACHOS. Enjoy.    [Music]  Host: Steve Love. Thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.    Steve Love: Really good to be here.    Host: Hey, this is very timely that we're talking. I know we've been trying to talk for a while, even ahead of when NACHOS launched to the International Space Station, but it seems, it seems like this is probably one of the better times to actually talk to you because now, when, you know, as we were talking a little bit just warming up before, before getting into the recording, you let me know that there's actually two NACHOS in space right now, two NACHOS CubeSats. So this seems, it seems like a very exciting time. Is, is, tell me about that, you know, just where you are; is, is, you know, this, this seems to be a better time for you.    Steve Love: Yeah. So, NACHOS-1, our original NACHOS that went to the space station, it was deployed out of the Cygnus vehicle on June 28, which was I guess about three weeks ago. And then just a few days later, on July 2, our second CubeSat, which we call NACHOS-2, was launched into orbit aboard a Virgin Orbit LauncherOne vehicle. This is one of these aircraft-launched rockets. So it took off on a 747 and was dropped and was one of, NACHOS-2 was one of seven satellites that that rocket deployed. So we weren't planning on having these go up so close together, but just, you know, the random schedule changes and stuff of these two launches, they ended up being in the same week. So yeah, it's very exciting and very kind of hectic. You know, we got two satellites to, to babysit and, bring online. You know, where we're at now is we're just going through the paces of bringing the, the instrument online, getting the satellite, you know, getting control of the satellite, getting the satellite stabilized, running, you know, state of health checks. So we don't have any real science data yet, that'll be coming pretty soon. But right now we're in our commissioning and checkout phase…  Host: Fantastic.   Steve Love: …on both satellites.  Host: So it's very timely. This is great. And that's what I wanted to get into is just what, what led us to where we are right now and then, like you said, there's, there's more to come. So we'll go into, we'll go into that a little bit more, and then we'll explore just the science behind what you're doing. I wanted to start though, Steve, by just talking a little bit about you because you have an interesting background in physics, and now, you're working on this CubeSat that's looking at the Earth. It just seems like, it seems like an interesting story arc for you. Can you tell me about, well let's start with physics, because I'm sure, you know, physics for me, I struggled in high school with physics, that was definitely not something that I found coming easy to me. But you continued to pursue physics in your education, so it must have been something that you were quite passionate about.    Steve Love: Yeah. Well, you know, when I started college, you know, I, I knew I wanted to be some kind of scientist; I didn't know, you know, exactly what. I was thinking chemistry. And in my chemistry classes, every time something really interesting came up, like, you know, how bonds and orbitals and stuff like that work, I'd start asking questions about that. The professor would always say, oh well, that's actually physics. You know, after about four times of, you know, oh this, this is really cool I want to know more about that and the answer is, well, that's actually physics, and I would say, well, maybe I better be in physics and not chemistry. And so that's kind of what, you know, things like that are what turned me on to physics as, as a career path. And, you know, I was always interested in space and astronomy. You know, I’m of an age where I, I remember the Moon landings; I was a little kid at the time, but that was, you know, I was like nine years old when Neil Armstrong, you know, walked on the Moon, and that was just like the coolest thing for me as a little kid. And that's sort of what really got me started. And then, and then, you know, my dad got me a telescope, you know, when I was a kid, I was always out with the telescope and stuff. So I was always interested in space and astronomy. So, you know, physics background was good for that, and as it turned out I didn't end up going into astronomy.  But…   Host: But, that physics, that physics background was just something that it seemed like was a way to pursue this, this very early interest in space, so is it true…  Steve Love: Yeah.   Host: …you were using physics as a route to get you into working in the space industry?    Steve Love: Yeah, you know, always in the back of my mind now, you know, as I moved through my graduate school career, you know, I just thought I, you know, I needed to be a bit more practical and, you know, go into something that will get me a job. So I, you know, I went into solid-state physics. You know, it's, it's fascinating in itself and, you know, you know, it's certainly something that, you know, gets you into the semiconductor industry or whatever, you know. So anyway, I sort of dropped the space stuff and, you know, all I can say, condensed matter physics is fascinating, and I be, my other sort of scientific passion was light and lasers, and so, you know, my doctoral work I used laser spectroscopy to study solids. So it used, used laser and impurities in solids to probe the properties of various kind of odd materials like, like glasses and disordered semiconductors. And so that got me into, you know, using optical probes to study things.   Host: I see the parallels here, because it's, the NACHOS, some of the instruments on board, contains some of these, some of these instruments: the, you know, a spectrometer that I think, you know, that's really important to whatever the science is that's being measured on NACHOS, and that seemed like sort of your entrance point, your expertise in spectroscopy and continuing to study that, eventually let you explore your passions for entering into this world of space.     Steve Love: Yeah. So, you know, I came here to Los Alamos as a postdoc. And I continued doing condensed matter physics. I did, and, you know, optical probes again, I did infrared and Raman spectroscopy of some very strange quality one-dimensional materials that were sort of related to the high temperatures of superconductors that were, you know, all the rage at that time. And, you know, when my postdoc wrapped up, you know, I needed to find a job and over in this other division at Los Alamos, where they do space stuff, you know, a job opened up: they needed somebody who had infrared expertise. And I thought, well, I've got that and I'm kind of ready to, you know, try something new. So I joined what is now called Space and Remote Sensing Group at Los Alamos, and that's pretty much where I’ve spent my career. And…  Host: Fantastic. That's, so yeah, and it's the, it, you got to explore space and remote sensing, that's, that's, that's the perfect place to do that. And, and you spent, you mentioned you spending your career there; I wonder, though, at what point in your career did this idea of these, you know, a CubeSat going into Earth and looking at these interesting aspects of Earth, I wonder when NACHOS really started coming into play?    Steve Love: OK, well, we can go back to my earlier life again as a start. You know, one thing that keeps coming back in addition to space stuff is volcanoes. So, I grew up in eastern Washington state; I was in college when Mount St. Helens erupted. So that's one of those events that, you know, for the rest of your life you remember exactly where you were and what you were doing on that day, because we had this cloud of volcanic ash turning day into night and raining down an inch of ash on us, and you know where I was and what I was doing was I was, I was about to start studying for a physics quiz the next day, and instead ended up watching the event unfold. So I've always had this fascination for the volcanos. OK, so now jump forward to Los Alamos. A group of us decided we really would like to start developing remote infrared spectroscopy, and one of the things we thought would be a good test bed for some of our ideas would be to look at volcanic gases using remote infrared spectroscopy. So, and so we hooked up with some vulcanologists, and so back kind of around 2000, thereabouts, like 20 years ago, you know, a group of us carted my infrared spectros, spectrometer to volcanoes around the world and we saw some really interesting things, particularly at this volcano Popocatepetl outside of Mexico City where I actually discovered a change in the gas composition involving kind of an obscure gas, silicon tetrafluoride. When its amount suddenly started increasing, it seemed to be an indicator that an eruption was about to occur. So that was kind of a big deal. And so we did that for a few years, but, you know, Los Alamos almost isn't really a geology laboratory, so that wasn't something I could continue to pursue full time. But, you know, we demonstrated the value of the techniques, got some good science out of it, and it kind of left me with the, you know, fascination with volcanoes. And so, you know, around that time we were also starting to do, as a group of laboratories -- Los Alamos, [Lawrence] Livermore [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] -- started looking into hyperspectral imaging for remote monitoring of chemicals. And I was fairly new at the time and, you know, as a collaboration we built an instrument, flew it on an airplane, and, you know, actually, and demonstrated this really works well. So, you know, just to back up, you know, hyperspectral imaging is imaging where every pixel of the image contains a high-resolution spectrum with hundreds of wavelength channels, so you can look at the detailed structure of the spectrum of gases and, you know, very reliably distinguish one gas from another and so, you know, every gas has its own spectral fingerprint of, you know, particular wavelengths that absorb and doesn't absorb, and every chemical is different. And that's the power of spectroscopy. I mean, we can, we can look at, you know, what stars are made of, you know, so that is a very powerful technique. And hyperspectral imaging, you might say, it's imaging with every pixel being a full high-resolution spectrum. So that's a lot of data. So at that time, that first instrument, it was huge; it was several hundred pounds, we basically, you know, flew it on an optics table, took up the whole payload day of this NASA high-altitude aircraft, the WB-57. And, you know, it kind of became clear to me at least that if this is going to be practical, if you want to, like maybe put this in space someday, we got to make it smaller. And so I started a series of instruments and inventions trying to make, mix this whole technique smaller and more portable, and so I had some earlier instruments, you know, within the back of the -- in back of my mind, someday putting it on either a small drone or a small satellite. And so, I, you know, I designed some miniaturized hyperspectral imagers, and this was really before CubeSats were a thing. There were still, you know, there were smaller satellites, but CubeSats hadn't really come into being yet back then. So but that was kind of the thrust of a lot of my work was making hyperspectral imaging more portable, less power-hungry; how do you deal with this massive block of data where, you know, hundreds of spectral channels in every pixel and then, you know, thousands and thousands of pixels -- that's a lot of data, and how do you handle that and how do you efficiently pull the information you want out of all that data?    Host: So then how, you know, that sounds very challenging, right, and that's, that's not that's, that's not a small difference in size from several hundred pounds to, you know, a very large instrumentation, to really miniaturizing it, and then, you know, eventually, we'll get to the point where we talk about NACHOS and I mean, CubeSats are small, they're like a loaf of bread size. They're, they're, they're very small. So that's, that's quite, what I would, what I would characterize as an engineering feat. So I'm guessing you had, you worked, you know, with, with a lot of engineers as you were exploring ways to miniaturize some of this technology and get it small, like you're saying, smaller and more portable. Who were some of the folks that you were working with to explore these upgrades in technology?    Steve Love: Yeah, so, engineers, optical designers, which I, I guess I count myself as one of those, and also, you know, mathematicians or mathematical physicists who, you know, work through, you know, dealing with the data in an efficient manner.    Host: Yeah. So it took a, a decent number of people to, to really put, to really put this thing together. So let me back up for a second, because a lot of the work that you were describing, Steve, was, you know, especially as we're, as we're leading into talking about NACHOS itself, I think there's this, there's this interesting collide of your physics and looking at spectroscopy and this hyperspectral technology, but there's this other component of your fascination with volcanoes, and you mentioned some work, some early work where you were going out and actually measuring some of the gases. I wonder, just in general, high-level, really what is interesting about these gases that are coming from volcanoes that are worth going out and measuring?    Steve Love: Yeah. Well, the, the gases are, you know, one of the few things that tell you what's going on down deep in the Earth. So, you know, when a volcano starts beginning to erupt there are gases dissolved in, in the, in the magma. And, you know, key gases are water, water vapor and carbon dioxide, but then the next most prominent one is sulfur dioxide, and then there's HCl (hydrogen chloride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride) and, you know, these strange gases, like I mentioned, silicon tetrafluoride. Well, you know, looking at how those relative concentrations change over time can give you hints of what, you know, what's going on, what kind of magma is, is being brought into play, how, you know, how hot it is, is it, things like that. You know, vulcanologists, the people who do this for a living, they like to go in and get as close as possible and actually, like, stick a tube in a, in a fumarole and sample the gas and, you know, look at the chemistry of, you know, everything that's going on there, not just the rock but the gases as well. And so, that's, you know, intrinsically kind of a dangerous thing. And so, you know, this remote spectroscopy stuff that I was doing was, you know, an attempt to be able to get this information at a safer distance, you know? So we went from vulcanologists who, you know, go and stick their face in the, in the fumarole to setting up several miles away and looking at, you know, the smoke coming out of the volcano. Depending on the volcano and what the chemistry is, it could actually give you a, you know, kind of warning of what might be coming next. And, you know, typically a volcano, when it first starts waking up, the, the first things that happen, there might be some seismic activity, but usually there's, you know, there's some sulfur dioxide emissions that, you know, are, are the other sign that, oh yeah, this volcano is no longer dormant, it's starting to, you know, start emitting things.    Host: So when it comes to the gases that you're measuring and the instruments that you were bringing out, you mentioned this idea of hyperspectral imaging and getting a really wide range of sensing the different gases and components that are coming out of volcanoes. I wonder if, is this something that you were able to bring out to different volcanoes or did you have more limited insight based on the technology that you remotely had at the time for taking these measurements?    Steve Love: Yeah. At the time, we didn't have imagers; we had a single point spectrometer: so you point the instrument at some place, and what I would typically do is I would point it at the, you know, the gas plume, and then I would point it at some clear sky upwind of the plume, and I would, you know, compare one to the other and that way I could see the gases that were in the, in the volcanic plume. Now, while I was doing that I was really wishing that I did have some imaging, because if you want to quantify the total amount of gas coming out, you want to measure, you know, how big the plume is and how fast the wind is blowing, and, you know, kind of, it was kind of a dream at the time be able to image all that, you know, saying we could measure the wind speed by watching this puff blow in the wind and if you had the imaging capability you could quantitatively measure the total gas output, which is what the vulcanologists are really interested in. I mean, you look at the composition and you also look at the total amount: if the amount of gas is increasing, that's also, you know, a warning that something more is probably on the way. So we didn't have anything at the time but, you know, that's one of the motivations for wanting to have the imaging capability.    Host: I see. OK. All right. So, so you did some work out in the field, you went to these different volcanoes. Now this opportunity, you know, as to, as you were doing this work to make this hyperspectral, these, these instruments smaller and smaller, more portable, as you say, I wonder, I wonder when the opportunity came about that you got it small enough that now it was ready for space. Let's talk about, let's talk about NACHOS and its inception on, like getting, getting ready to go. Tell me about some of the, the early work?  Steve Love: Yeah. So it all started about, I guess about seven years ago. There was a, effort at Los Alamos to, to build CubeSats. So they were pretty new at the time. So we had a series of CubeSats, and they were, they were, one and a half U. Now, let me back up.  You know, CubeSats are a standard for very small satellites, and the basic building block is a four-inch cube, and that's, that's the basic unit of the CubeSat standard is a four-inch cube and that's, that's called a “U” for unit, I guess. And so, we had – “we” meaning Los Alamos, not me, but people in my division at Los Alamos -- had developed these one and a half U CubeSats that actually put quite a few of them, like a dozen of them in orbit. And they continued developing them, and the next generation of them they decided, well, we could actually add a payload hosting capability. I mean, they had their own internal instrument, which, which is a radio frequency instrument, but they thought, well, you know, we've got the satellite technology for all the attitude control and, communication and telemetry and all that stuff, so we could actually host a payload. And so, the next generations they built they designed it with this sort of plug and play interface which could accommodate another one and a half U payload. So altogether you'd have a 3U CubeSat. And as you say, that, you know, a 3U CubeSat is just about the size of a loaf of bread. You know, it's four inches by four inches by 12 inches. And so, it was basically a brainstorming session: got together with those guys, was myself and atmospheric scientist Manvendra Dubey, and Nick Dallmann, who was leading that CubeSat effort at the time, a couple of young engineers -- Logan Ott is a mechanical engineer on NACHOS, he's been there from the very beginning, and he was just a, just barely out school at the time. So just this small group of us got together and started talking about, well, what, what kind of payload should we put on one of these, and, you know, everybody looking at me -- hey, Steve, could you maybe fit one of your hyperspectral imagers in a, a one and a half U, you know, package? And I thought, well, that's a challenge, but, let me look into it, you know?   Host: Yeah.  Steve Love: And, and, you know, chatting with Dubey, the atmospheric scientist, you know, well, what do we need, you know, what kind of sensitivity, what do we look at, how good does the instrument need to be? And again, you know, as I came back going, well, that's kind of challenging, let me see if I can do anything. So, you know, so I went back and did some preliminary designs, did some calculations of sensitivities that we could achieve and spectral resolution that we could achieve in a package that small and  surprise surprise, actually, you know, just looks doable, just barely, but I think it's doable. And so, you know, I ginned up an optical design, and actually made it and made the design fit, you know, at least on paper; actually, the optics all fits in a 1U cube. And then we reserved a half U, you know, two inches by four inches by four inches, for, for the electronics. And so we went through a series of projects. We originally went straight to NASA and proposed this, to launch a constellation of these things we'd never built, and, you know, it was just to be, you know, a little bit too ambitious and unproven at the time. So then we went to our internal funding and we, we got a fairly large internally-funded project, which we called Targeted Atmospheric Chemistry Observations from Space. And that little acronym, TACOS, that, that was Logan, mechanical engineer Logan Ott came out with that one. So our original project was called TACOS, and that was all internally funded Los Alamos money. And we went through, you know, the full design and, and prototyping of this concept, and got it to the point where, yeah, we have a working prototype that's almost, you know, space deployable now. And that's when we proposed to NASA Earth Science [and] Technology Office in their InVEST call, that's the In-Space Validation of Earth Science Technologies. And if we were mature enough in our technology at that point that we know we, we won that proposal and, and, the powers that be said that, well, this is a new project and you need a new name. So, we actually put our heads together and said, OK, our first project was called TACOS, so let's stick with the Mexican food theme, what can we come up with? [Laughter] And it was kind of, it was kind of a group effort. And we came up with NACHOS, which is NanoSat Atmospheric Chemistry Hyperspectral Observation System. It's actually, you know, even more descriptive name than the original TACOS. So that's exactly what it is.    Host: Oh, that's fantastic.    Steve Love: So that's, that's how NACHOS came about. I don't know what we're going to do, you know, with the next project, if it's going to be SALSA or ENCHILADA or what, but…    Host: I feel like the more complicated it is, you know, the, the longer the word, you know? As you'll get to a point where you'll be naming a, a, a, a satellite QUESADILLA; you know, have fun with that one.   Steve Love: Exactly, yeah.  Host: That’ll be interesting.  Steve Love: Yeah.    Host: Very good. OK. Awesome. Well, well, congratulations. You know, I know it seems like it was a combination of, you know, a little bit of timing and a little bit of preparation, too, your efforts into some of these other ways sort of prepared you so that when you were able to get this award for, for this Earth science part of things that you just happened to have the right maturity and the right expertise in the proposals and, and all of that where you finally got the opportunity to, to launch to space.    Steve Love: That's right, yeah.    Host: Very good. All right. So, you got, you got it down, you got the, you got the technology down to, the size that you wanted; you started building it. Talk about the process of, once this thing was, you know, built, what you did to test it and then eventually get it integrated into Northrop Grumman Cygnus?    Steve Love: Yeah. So, you know, there's a whole sort of standard slew of tests. You know, first we had to, you know, test the optics, you know, and, and, well actually, you know, there was quite a bit of work going from the design to reality of the spectrometer. There were some issues that came up when we were building it, like our grating was manufactured backwards. We couldn’t figure out why we weren't getting enough light, very much light through the system at all until we realized, oh, it, the diffraction grating is sending light to the opposite direction from where it's supposed to go. You know, a whole bunch of little problems like that. But, you know, coming up with the technique for aligning and focusing this tiny little instrument that's, you know, the smaller you make things the smaller the adjustments you have to make, and one of the real challenges was, you know, there's no way we're going to be able to put motors on mirror mounts and things like that and focus this in space. We had to, you know, focus it on the ground, we had to build it rigid and robust enough that it could survive launch and stay in focus. OK. So we went through several iterations of our optics mounts, making them heftier and stiffer, and, and, you know, every time we would, you know, do a vibration take, test, so we, you know, there are, we have a vibration testing shake table that mimics the vibrations of a rocket, and you can actually program in the vibrational spectrum of a particular rocket if you want to. There's NASA standards for, you know, how hard you have to shake it to, to imitate what an actual launch would be like. So, you know, we would design the optics, get everything aligned, shake it and find out, oh, it went out of focus; OK, we need to modify that mount; OK, let's try it again. And finally after about three iterations, OK, we got, we got a design that works. And so then we, you know, we have the optics in place for it. And then, you know, it's not just the optics, it's all the electronics; everything has to survive that. So you do the vibration test, and then you have to simulate the space environment. So the other major part of the testing is thermal vacuum testing. So you put it in a vacuum chamber that you can cool down the walls of so it's, you know, imitates the, the cold of, of space. So, yeah, we have the, the walls of the chamber cooled with liquid nitrogen, and so then you have to run, make sure your electronics all work. We had to design the optics so that it would stay in focus as the temperature changed. So, you know, our spectrometer had to be made out of all aluminum -- the mirrors, the grating, you know, the, the mounts -- so that when it heated up and cooled down it would all expand and contract in the same way and stay in focus. And so, we, you know, we had to run the entire satellite through the thermal vacuum testing, you know, cycle the temperature down to the lowest temperature we would expect to, to encounter and up to the highest temperature. So it would be like minus 40 degrees C up to plus, plus 40, roughly speaking; I make sure everything works and survives through all those temperatures. And, you know, and of course, doing that, you know, a few other things, like in the electronics, would break and we have to figure out why and fix it and modify it, and then finally, you, you pass all those tests, you say, OK, we're, we're ready. We can, we can deliver this thing to be launched.    Host: Did you get to go out to [NASA] Wallops [Flight Facility] and actually watch it?   Steve Love: I did, yes. I went out to Wallops and that was last, you know, all these years in this space technology group, this is my very first, you know, live rocket launch I ever witnessed. So that was, that was a, that was a treat. Yeah.    Host: [Laughter] A treat, because not only did you get to see a cool rocket launch, but there was something that you put a lot of, you know, a lot of work into on board the vehicle. So not, it was, you know, I feel like that's probably more emotional than just the average, you know, rocket watcher.    Steve Love: Yeah. Well, it definitely is. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, it's all these sort of mixed emotions, you know, it's, it's kind of like sending your kid off to college or something, right?   Host: Yeah.  Steve Love: You have this machine you've built, you've had your hands on for years, and now, it's, you know, you're watching it blast into the sky and you're keeping your fingers crossed that it's a safe journey, and you, you know, you kind, you kind of miss it. Yeah. [Laughter]  Host: Yeah. Now, you said, you know, after, after launch, we went through this at, at the beginning of our chat, is since, since it's launched, you know, enough time has passed now that it, it launched to the International Space Station, which has a CubeSat deployer, and that first CubeSat has been deployed. And then you already mentioned that, that another one was launched as well. So now you got two NACHO[S] CubeSats in orbit. I, I feel like when we were talking about all the testing and stuff, we were talking about one, but what is the reason for that second one?    Steve Love: Well, that's a good question, actually. So originally, the, the second one was meant to be a test unit. So it's kind of standard practice to build a, what's called a qualification model, and then the actual flight unit. So we've built two identical satellites. And, you know, the idea is the qualification model, you can put it through more rigorous testing, you know, take higher risks with it, you know, of possibly breaking it while you're shaking it too hard. And then when you, you know, convince yourself that the qualification model works, then you run the, the flight instrument through, you know, the same set of tests, but not, you don't quite shake it as hard or bake it as hard, and you try to be a little bit gentler with it for, because this is the real one and you already know what's going to work because you did the qualification model. So we had the two satellites and the qualification model passed its test with flying colors. So we had a working satellite in our hands in addition to the, you know, what was originally intended to be the, the one and only flight satellite. And, when it came time for finding a launch, the, you know, we weren't quite sure if the space station orbit would work for us or not. And we actually ended up, because it's a rather low orbit, and we have deployable solar panels that pop out and they actually create some drag in that, you know, very low-Earth orbit, tenuous upper atmosphere. So, we were worried that the orbital lifetime wouldn't be quite as long as we would like. And so one thing we did, we actually added ballast, just some extra weight, to our satellite. So the, the as-designed satellite was about eight pounds total, and we added another five pounds of just, of weight to it, to make it, you know, improve its mass to area ratio so that drag didn't affect much. But anyway, during that time we were looking into various launch options, and so we applied to the Air Force's Space Test Program, and they really liked our satellite, and they, you know, very quickly said, yeah, we'll, we'll include you on our next launch. OK. Actually, you know, the NASA launch, we applied for the CubeSat launch initiative launch, and it was about six months before they kind of came back and said congratulations, you know.  But, you know, this STP launch, that, that came back like a, in a week. So now we got two launches, basically, you know, little to no cost to us, so [we thought] OK, well, we got two satellites, let's just do it. So, you know, we, we had always hoped that if the opportunity came along we could launch our qualification model and, and, and do a second satellite. But, you know, I didn't expect the opportunity to fall into my lap quite so, so quickly. So we just went ahead and, you know, chatted with the NASA folks and everybody was happy with this idea, hey, hey, we're going to have two satellites -- we want to do a constellation, we want to do like, you know, 10 or 20 satellites eventually. So let's do two and try to get them where they, their missions overlap so we can kind of, you know, test, you know, having two satellites orbit looking at the same targets, higher frequency. And so that all worked out great. And you know, as I was saying, a little bit more simultaneous than we had been planning on, but, so yeah, we got two satellites.    Host: That's great. You mentioned, you mentioned the challenges of low-Earth orbit with, with the extra drag and adding weight. Where, where did the other one launch? Is it in that same orbit and you had to work through the same things, or is, is it somewhere else?    Steve Love: Well, it's a little, it's a little higher.   Host: A little higher.  Steve Love: So, the first one is basically the space station orbit, so it's about 400 and something kilometers up. And the second one is at a 500-kilometer orbit. So you know, about a little over 300 miles up. So, you know, at 500 kilometers, you know, we expect it to come down in, you know, maybe about three years. You know, these CubeSats are required to come down within, I believe it's 20 years, so we don't want them just turn to space junk.  Host: Right.  Steve Love: So we never get to launch them into super-high orbit. So we, you know, CubeSats go into fairly low orbits where we know their orbit will decay, and they'll, you know, be out of the space junk picture before too long.    Host: [Laughter] I see. All right. Well, with two, with two satellites in orbit, you mentioned at the beginning of our talk you have to, you know, right now, you have two satellites in orbit, that's great, you got to go through activating them and getting them online and everything. What is in store for what these satellites are actually going to do? Let's talk about the science a little bit. What's on board these, these hyperspectral imaging, and then what, what data are they going to be sending down to you so that you can do what?    Steve Love: OK, so, you know, the actual hyperspectral imagers, these are ultraviolet, visible, the 300-to-500 nanometers, which is basically, 500 nanometers is like a blue/green color, and then the spectral range extends into the near ultraviolet. And so in that spectral range you can see nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, formaldehyde; you can characterize aerosols, distinguish sort of clean, purely-scattering aerosols – that, you know, just scatter the, the sunlight -- from sooty aerosols from fires that absorb sun, sunlight. And that's a very important thing for the climate scientists. If you see an aerosol haze, what kind of, what kind of aerosol is it? Because the city ones absorb sunlight and add to the warming; the clean aerosols reflect sunlight and have a cooling effect. So being able to distinguish those is important. There's several other volcanic gases. There's chlorine oxide, bromine oxide, iodine oxide, and these are fairly new to remote sensoring of volcanic gases, so we're going to be looking at those, too. So the instrument itself…we, you know, the T in TACOS is, is targeted. And so, we aimed this to fill a niche that this was kind of empty. So there are other satellites, large satellite instruments that have similar sorts of spectrometers on them, much bigger. The one we sort of modeled our capabilities on is one call, it's the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, OMI, O-M-I. And that instrument, well, it's about 150 pounds for the instrument itself, and I told you my, our satellite with added weight is only 13 pounds, but, you know, spectroscopically it's very similar. But in terms of its imaging, its mission is to map the entire globe every day. So it does it at a very core spectral spatial resolution. So a single OMI pixel is over a hundred square miles; it's about, what is it,  about eight by 15 miles. So for instance, you know, the entire city of Washington, D.C. is about half of an OMI pixel.   Host: Oh, OK.   Steve Love: And so, we want to look at the same gases, but do it at much finer spatial resolution. So, the NACHOS single pixel is about, about a thousand feet on the side, basically -- 300, 300 to 400 kilom, meters, excuse me, on a side. So it's roughly, instead of being bigger than a city, it's about the size of a big sports stadium. That's, that's the best object I can think of that's about the size a NACHOS pick, pixel. OK. So we have, you know, these relatively tiny pixels, at least for this kind of space-based hyperspectral observation, and so now we can look at, you know, much smaller things, you know. Think about volcanoes. OK, so we can see sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases, but now we can see things on this sort of more human scale. So, you know, instruments like OMI, they've measured gases from volcanoes but only for very big eruptions. So if the volcano explodes and generates this cloud that wraps around the globe, OMI and satellites like it can, can see that. But they can't see a volcano that's just waking up and just starting to fume a bit, you know, in the kind of state where vulcanologists would want to go in and, you know, stick their tubes into the fumaroles. But with NACHOS-sized pixels we can, we can see those early stages of a volcano waking up. So that's one of the exciting things. And then, looking at, so we, we've kind of got two, two thrusts here: we got the vulcanology and then we have, you know, air pollution monitoring and indirectly looking at greenhouse gases. So, you know, our other main target gas is NO2. NO2, nitrogen dioxide, is, is the gas that makes smog look brown. OK. It's, and it's, you know, one, it's toxic: most of the health effects of smog, you know, lung damage, asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and so forth, are caused by NO2. NO2 and ozone, which actually NO2 is involved in making smog ozone. And so we're interested in looking at NO2 production on this fine scale and understand, it's kind of complex chemistry that goes on, you know? You know, NO2 or nitrogen oxides is very, you know, is various nitrogen oxides, and they're produced by heating air really hot. So internal combustion engines, power plants that burn coal, those are kind of the chief, you know, manmade sources of NO2. Natural sources are things like lightning and forest fires and to some extent volcanoes too. Anytime you get air, which is nitrogen and oxygen, really hot, you'll mix these nitro -- nitrogen oxides. And so NO2 is a marker for burning. And, you know, particularly, you know, burning fossil fuels like an internal combustion engine or coal-fired power plants. And what's nice about it is, it's very easy to detect in the visible, ultraviolet region. It's got a very strong and distinctive spectral signature. It's much easier to detect than carbon dioxide itself, which is kind of tricky because there's a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So, you know, apart from, you know, the pollution monitoring aspect, or at least, you know, the actual toxicity of NO2, it's also a really nice tracer for greenhouse gases. It's not an important greenhouse gas in itself, but wherever you burn fossil fuels you make NO2 in addition to CO2. So, you know, it's a way of, of tracking and quantifying fossil fuel burning.    Host: There's a lot of components to this, and it seems like you're measuring a lot. You're talking about the instruments you have on board and NACHOS being able to, to monitor, to look at, to measure exactly what's happening. But I wonder, to take it a step further, what are your hopes as you're collecting these data and you're getting a better understanding of, you know, where these gases are and, and you're taking these measurements, and contributing these, these data to the scientific community, do you have any like hypothesis or goal or, or objective to, on how to compile these data and put something together to measure something? What, what, what are the goals of NACHO[S]?    Steve Love: I guess, you know, the overall goal is to measure these atmospheric chemistry processes at a much finer spatial scale that has been done before. At least that's, that's the atmospheric science side of it. And then in parallel, you know, for the vulcanology, this will really be the first time we can do real sort of eruption-warning kind of monitoring of volcanoes from space. You know, before everything that was done in terms of looking at volcanic gases is, is like, hey, you could see a big eruption after it happened, but you can't see the, the lead up to it because that's just too small. And so having that, you know, tiny pixel enables you to see the small early stuff. But with going back to the pollution monitoring side, as I mentioned, that's the NO2, the nitrogen oxide chemistry, is kind of complex. You burn, you know, fossil fuel, you get the air hot, it makes NO; that reacts with the oxygen and the atmosphere to make NO2. If there's sunlight, NO2 can react with the oxygen in the atmosphere again to make ozone in addition. And then depending on whether there’s sunlight or not, and, you know, the reactions can go either direction. And, you know, this is all happening on a much smaller spatial scale than any instrument currently in space, until NACHOS, could, could resolve. So, you know, all these existing instruments have sort of city-sized pixels, and now we've got stadium-sized pixels. And so now we can actually, we hope, you know, actually see this chemistry going on in a spatially-resolved way and be able to feed that into air quality models, for instance; understand what the real chemistry is on this fine spatial scale as, you know, you convert from NO to NO2 to ozone, then go back and, and so forth.    Host: So now I'm getting a better understanding of why that constellation idea that, that hope for, for, for you guys is, is your next goal really. It sounds, sounds like the two, with these very fine measurements, you're adding to the, you know, the scientific community something that hasn't been contributed before on this smaller scale. But maybe I'm, I'm right in interpreting that with more satellites you get this fine coverage over a wider area in a shorter amount of time. So is that really your objective with this effort to try to get more satellites up there?    Steve Love: That is exactly it, yes. Yeah, because we have this, you know, telephoto kind of look at things, we can't cover lots of area with one satellite. We look at targets, you know, individual targets, and, you know, exactly when we can. We can't look at the whole world at once, but, you know, the more satellites we have the more things we can look at and the more frequently we can look at them. So we would like to be able to, for instance, watch a volcano as it's, you know, goes through its process of becoming more active, or watch this pollution chemistry in a city over the course of days or over the course of a day, you know, because sunlight play such a role in, in this chemistry and you know, what people are doing during the course of the day matters as well. And, you know, with one satellite you might be able to look at a given target once a day maybe; so, you know, having ten satellites, you might be able to look at the same target ten times a day at this, you know, much finer spatial resolution.  Host: I understand. So it's more, it's more coverage, but then it's, it's, it's more regular intervals of, of monitoring some of these locations as well. And that's, and that's good for the data.  Steve Love: Right.  Host: OK. Very good.   Steve Love: Yeah.   Host: There's a lot of ambition here, Steve. Lots, lots to do. And I, and I wonder, I want to end on just sort of a broader picture here on, you know, you spend a lot of time on, on working on these technology and, and now you have a chance to contribute some unique data to the scientific community. I wonder, when you think about just the pursuit of, of space as a, as a place to make these measurements and the open opportunity you have to get launches, as you said, for, for very little cost to the, to the university, to the laboratory, so it's just, there's, there's a lot, there's a lot of open opportunity and it seems like it's something that's important for scientists to pursue, to have a better understanding of, of our planet. What is your hope for NACHOS in what, you know, what, you know, Los Alamos and what NACHOS are able to contribute to the scientific community, whether it's something broader like, you know, observing and adding to the data of climate change or just a better understanding of our planet, what are your hopes for the experiment specifically?    Steve Love: Yeah, well, I mean, a better understanding of our planet, definitely. You know, specifically, I mean, I'm, I'm really excited about the improved spatial resolution and what you can do with being able to see finer details. And we were actually fairly conservative with what kind of lens we put on the front of our instrument. And that was, that was all driven by what we thought our satellite could do in terms of pointing at a target accurately. So we chose a 15-degree field of view, which is about like a moderate telephoto lens on a camera, like a portrait lens, like. But there's nothing optical about, that says we couldn't make, put a much bigger telephoto lens on, on, on our instrument. And we are, you know, expecting to get much better pointing accuracy than we were ex, you know, imagining when we first started this project. So we could actually do much finer spatial resolution than stadium-sized pixels; that would be fairly easy to do. So, you know, I'm excited about being able to resolve, you know, the, this pollution chemistry, how these gases are formed on, you know, sort of this, you know, neighborhood scale rather than just a big blotch that's, you know, one pixel is a city…   Host: Yeah.   Steve Love: …being able to understand that.  I, I'm very, you know, especially excited about being able to look at volcanoes and, in that sort of detail, and, you know, not just for eruption prediction but for understanding of volcanoes and, and hopefully spotting things that, you know, haven't been spotted before. Like lots of volcanoes have vents that open up on the flanks of volcanoes away from the main crater; we could spot those from space. We can, you know, from space you could look at, you know, all these remote volcanoes that, you know, you can't send a crew of vulcanologists every one of these things. You know, the, the big ones, the main ones that are close to cities, you know, of course, the geologists are keeping a close eye on those, but there's, you know, hundreds of volcanoes around the world and being able to monitor all of them, you know, from space on a regular basis, like you could do with a constellation, that would be wonderful.   Host: That would be. That's great. You're excited for the data. And, and I think more so, I think what, what's coming out to me and, and what I'm sort of locking onto is your early fascination with space and your early fascination with volcanoes. You get to explore that now. That's, that's what you have ahead of you and I think that's, that sounds really exciting. So, Steve Love, it's been an absolute pleasure to, to talk with you today, learn more about NACHOS and, you know, after two, the successful deployments of, of both of the satellites you got some very interesting data that you're going to be collecting heading your way very soon. So, it, it seems like a very exciting time, and I'm, and I'm glad to be able to share that with you. Thanks for coming on.    Steve Love: Well, thanks a lot.  [Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Learned a lot from Steve Love today about the NACHOS experiment. Some great data is going to be coming down, and in fact at this point might already be coming down from the satellites. So Steve and his group will be making some observations and hopefully adding to the great scientific community what's going on with volcanoes and air quality in cities. So some interesting stuff coming, thanks to the opportunities on the International Space Station and these different launch opportunities, and of course, his work to minimize the technology to get it on a CubeSat.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 261, “The New Class of Flight Directors.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. NASA's Mission Control Center here in Houston is constantly staffed to support humans in space for continuing International Space Station missions, and soon for Artemis missions. Individuals in this facility oversee crew safety and mission success. At the helm, NASA flight directors are calling the shots and overseeing all of the operations happening from launch to landing. Following in the footsteps of the great flight directors like Gene Kranz, and mission control’s namesake, Christopher C. Kraft, NASA has selected seven new flight directors to add to the rare and historic position that leads human spaceflight operations. These folks are taking on the very real and very serious responsibility of making critical decisions during a spaceflight, with all the flight controllers and especially the astronauts leaning on their expertise and demeanor to make the tough calls. It takes a great amount of skill, discipline, and expertise to even be chosen for a position such as this. Joining us today, we're honored to have four of NASA's newest class of flight directors to talk with us about their new role at NASA, the journey to how they got there, what they are looking forward to, and how their expertise will be critical in humanity’s return to the Moon, and eventually future exploration of Mars. Joining us [are] Ronak Dave, Garrett Hehn, Nicole McElroy, and Elias Myrmo. With that, let's get right into it. Enjoy.    [Music]  Host: The new class of flight directors, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. Really excited to get into this and especially why you choose to do this crazy job; really important stuff, but we'll, we'll get right into it. A lot of you guys here today, thank you all for being here, because there's seven of you that were selected and four of you decided to be on this podcast, let's just start by just getting our listeners acclimated with your voices. Ronak, why don't we start with you: tell me about you, you started as a co-op and then eventually made your way to becoming a flight director. Tell me about your journey.    Ronak Dave: Yeah, sure, Gary. So my name's Ronak Dave. Like Gary mentioned, I started here at JSC as a Pathways intern, formally known as the co-op program back in 2011…we actually spent some time together in that program. NASA was somewhere I always wanted to work and, and luckily got the opportunity through that program to work here at JSC and do exactly what I wanted to do in working in human spaceflight operations. And over the four semesters I spent here, that allowed me to leverage a full-time position in the operations world, and luckily got a full-time position here at JSC, started working in ISS operations, moved on to working on CST-100 Starliner operations, and then SLS (Space Launch System) the launch, big launch vehicle, and Orion spacecraft operations.    Host: So, a little bit of everything.  Ronak Dave: Little bit of everything.    Host: OK, that's good. I guess it was, do you think that was that diversity where you just tried a little bit of things where that eventually sort of led you to thinking, maybe I want to be a, maybe want to take it to the next step?    Ronak Dave: Yeah, I think that was definitely a part of my thought process, even back as a Pathways intern my intent was to see as much of the operations world as I could. So I intentionally went to different operational organizations to see how they were thinking, what their problems were and, and how that kind of fit into the big picture. So that is something I think definitely helped me get to where I am today.    Host: Awesome. Good to have you, Ronak. Garrett, what about you? What led you to where you are?    Garrett Hehn: Yeah, I, I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2014 and I knew I wanted to do engineering. I think the sheer number of LEGOs in my parents' attic are probably the, the best evidence of that fact. But I was a little different in that, you know, I was very, very excited to join NASA. I don't think it was always the goal, I never really knew or looked that far ahead. And kind of as I went through my time in school, I just wanted to work on the fastest and the most extreme environments, and that kind of led me to aerospace which ultimately led me here. And I jumped at the opportunity to join the trajectory operations officers, the TOPOs, that work on console for ISS. Orbital mechanics was my favorite class in college, so it was a pretty brilliant fit. I think what allowed me to get there and has helped me reach the level of the flight director is just teamwork, knowing how to work on a team, knowing how to lead a team. When I was at Virginia Tech I was a part of the swim team. I swam for the first two years and I was a coach for the last two. And so, I recognized kind of the parallels when I got here in MCC (Mission Control Center), how much I loved being part of the team, and as soon as I walked in the room and saw the flight director as the leader, I kind of put in my mind of, you know, that, that's the goal that I want. And, really, really excited. It's, it's an honor, honestly, to be selected.    Host: The leadership mentality seems to be consistent. Was it you, you mentioned the swim team, you were also an instructor for quite some bit, some, sometime too.  Garrett Hehn: Yeah. Yeah. The, the TOPOs are a pretty small and agile group. There's not a lot of the, the trajectory folks, and so those of us who achieved the certification, all of us acted as instructors as well.   Host: Yeah.  Garrett Hehn: So kind of teaching that next generation, being able to pass on lessons learned, being able to set an example, even in just your behaviors, I think is a big part of it.    Host: Awesome. Awesome. Good to have you, Garrett. Elias, what about you? What led you here?    Elias Myrmo: Yeah, so I was born and raised in Naples, Florida. Growing up in Florida we had a lot of space shuttle launches and really, since I was, as long as I can remember, was just enamored by NASA and the space program. So really, my whole track was always to get out to Houston. Growing up in Naples, which has beautiful beaches, everyone kind of looked at me weird when I was like, I want to move, I know I want to move to Houston when I grow up.    Host: They’re like, why? [Laughter]  Elias Myrmo: Yeah. Like, why would you want to do that to yourself? So I graduated from the University of Central Florida, had an opportunity while going to UCF actually to intern out here in the operations planner’s group, who kind of manages the timelines for, for the astronauts, and really got my first taste of, of mission control and, and kind of growing up and, and looking towards mission control, that's kind of where I wanted to work. But you really don't know until you show up here, is it going to be everything you think it is? And, and it was; I still get goosebumps walking through mission control today. So graduated and then ended up getting a job, working on the computer infrastructure inside of mission control, so get, got to work on this really complex, amazing building, learning about how all of the, the wiring and the computers work behind the scenes and how they support all of our human spaceflight programs. I showed up here before the shuttle had retired so I got to work on some of that. Worked on Constellation, which really is, through its ashes became Artemis, so had some familiarity with a lot of the, the things that we’re doing for Artemis today. But ultimately wanted to be a flight controller, so when I showed up, I had been hired by somebody that was, kind of my mentor when I was an intern, and obviously in infrastructure I wasn't a flight controller yet but had an agreement that after two years of service with MCC infrastructure, I could go be a flight controller. So two years on the day, I walked in and I was like, hey, it’s time to make good on that promise. And they sent me over to be a CRONUS (Communication Radio Frequency Onboard Networks Utilization Specialist), which manages all the, the computers and the communications equipment on the space station.  Host: Yeah, and the cameras. We love you guys.  Elias Myrmo: And, and the cameras. Beautiful views of the external cameras, which are now high definition.   Host: Yeah.    Elias Myrmo: Back, back then they were standard def[inition], so we've had a lot of fun upgrades over the years. So I was able to do that for, for about five years; had a blast just working in mission control, racked up about 2000 hours, supported all sorts of missions, kind of the first cargo missions, got to lead an increment. It was, it was just a lot of fun. And then after those five years -- kind of like Ronak -- I thought diversity, the goal was always flight director but getting diversity in operations I thought was important, so had an opportunity to actually be the group lead, or basically lead of a flight control discipline. In this instance it was the FDOs, or Flight Dynamics Officers, for Artemis. So kind of similar to Garrett, it was the trajectory officers for the Artemis mission, which again, was, I also love learning new things and this was all new. My degree is in computer science; these guys were a bunch of rocket scientists figuring out how to go to the Moon. There was a steep learning curve, but they were really just an amazing group of folks that a lot of them actually had worked on shuttle. So, so go from this kid, like watching the space shuttle and enamor[ed of] these flight, flight controllers and now kind of leading them as we go back to the Moon was, was really an honor in and of itself. So did that for about five years and then, recently got selected as flight director obviously. So again, kind of that diversity of experience throughout the entire time and the thing that I just love about operations is it's something different every day. And I love problem solving. So it's, it's different, it's in space and it's, it's solving problems every day. And, and really the, the Flight Director Office is, is the pin, pinnacle of that, right? You get to span all the programs, all of the technical disciplines. That's always kind of, again, been the goal. So like, like Garrett, I'd say, I'm honored and privileged really to, to be part of this office now.    Host: Yeah. You think it was your pursuit to get out of your comfort zone and try something, I mean, being the only computer science with a guy, bunch of guys who were like, probably, you know, dedicated most of their career to orbital mechanics, you, you know, that's, that can be an uncomfortable position, but you tried it anyway.    Elias Myrmo: It, it was certainly uncomfortable to start with. Yeah. It was really to find the common areas, right? It turns out that a lot of people don't use slide rules anymore, they actually use software, so the computer science pieces of saying -- yeah, your listeners probably don't know what a slide rule is; [Laughter] go Google “slide rule,” there's, there's a really good Wikipedia. So, but, but now you had all this software, so, and, and it's a bunch of rocket scientists that, that know how to do all the math but, but don't know necessarily the software requirements. So there was definitely a good mesh in there…   Host: Nice.   Elias Myrmo: …that we earned each other's respect pretty quickly.   Host: Very cool.  Elias Myrmo: But it was cool to learn from them too.   Host: Very Good. Good to have you.   Garrett Hehn: I actually got to start working under Elias for the past couple years when I got to do lead for Artemis II as one of the FDOs. And I can definitely attest of Elias's ability to see the bigger picture, which can be tough when you have a lot of, you know, super-math-heavy people like myself that are excited to talk about math and, and do math all the time. You know, I, I definitely saw his ability to, kind of, kind of lead that group and shape the way we were headed, so, you know, it was no surprise to me to see that he was also selected.     Host: I would definitely want to hit that, that idea of the bigger picture, because I feel like as a flight director that's probably one of the more important things, right, to pull back and not get terribly in the weeds and trust your team to get into the weeds. Well, we'll circle back on that real quick. Nicole, you have a little bit of a different trajectory, right? All these guys spent a lot of time at NASA, not so much for you.   Nicole McElroy: Yeah, definitely a little bit different. So I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in mechanical engineering. And then out of school went to go work for Virgin Orbit, which is a small launch company in Los Angeles. I actually interned there between my junior and senior year and then came back full-time. I was working in the propulsion team doing systems design, which is pretty much everything that's not the engine on the rocket, so all of the pressurization fill valves, all the rest of the systems. And then as we were developing and building our very first rocket, I was one of the system level people that understood how all of the different parts needed to come together, so I was really involved with physically putting the first rocket together and then figuring out what to do with the first rocket and how to get it actually working. One of my favorite meetings was like sitting in a room that was like, oh, how do we turn it on? Like, we have all these power systems, we have all these propulsion systems, but like, what button do we push? So things like that along the way, of figuring out system-level integration between all these different teams that had done all this different design, which then turned into system-level testing, which was the whole vehicle, we went through a stage test campaign which is hot firing the engines while connected to the tanks using the flight computers and the avionics, and pretty much proving that the rocket works on the ground before you try to launch it for the first time. So that got me excited about doing operations and then I continued to go into the launch operations side of the world and follow the rocket through the first four launches while I was there. The first two, I was the rocket specialist on console, so kind of looking over the entire rocket systems, and then the second two that I was there for I was the launch director, so very similar to a flight director role here but really integrating all of the different teams. We had teams that represented rocket systems, teams that represented ground systems, teams that represented plane systems, because we were unique in the fact that we launch off of the wing of a 747. And all of those systems had to be ready for launch day. So I was responsible for the rocket, essentially once it left the factory and then all of the work to get it ready for launch and actually get it off the ground on launch day.    Host: That's a lot of responsibility. What made you want to take on that level of responsibility as, like, you could have stayed at the systems level, right?  Nicole McElroy: Sure.  Host: You wanted to, you wanted to lead, you wanted to keep going. What…    Nicole McElroy: Definitely. I think it's similar to everyone here is like, again, being able to see the big picture in that system, whereas I understood how the rocket worked but you really actually need the rocket, the ground, the plane, all the data systems all working together to make the day successful. And I kept wanting to see more, right? Like, and kind of see more of how those puzzle pieces could really come together such that the day was successful overall.    Host: So we'll start with you Nicole, and then I want to go sort of around to everybody here and just sort of understand this opportunity came up to be a flight director. And I want to start with you because yours I think is particularly interesting in the, in the fact that you're coming from a different world and now you have to enter into being a flight director. What, what attracted you to this position to take on that next step?    Nicole McElroy: Yeah. It was really kind of the excitement of being able to use a lot of those skills and a lot of that experience of integrating a team, and working through live operations, doing console work, and then put and apply that to something as cool and as exciting as human spaceflight. So it was a next exciting step for me, probably a little bit different to everyone else. I applied on USAJOBS.gov and just like submitted my application into the void; it was like, OK, we'll see what happens. But then got the call to come in for an interview and did a couple rounds of interviewing and, it all worked out that got me here. But I'm excited to be able to kind of integrate some different perspectives and different backgrounds into a very established role at the moment working on the ISS and then continue to build that as we go through the next, next series of getting ready for everything.    Host: Now, one thing that I think, before I forget to ask you is, one, one thing that I think is a unique perspective of yours is the culture, right? These guys…  Nicole McElroy: Yeah.   Host: …these guys definitely have been in the flight operations culture for a long time, right, for very long time. This one, I mean, of course, you know, you, you're not, you're not unfamiliar with operations…  Nicole McElroy: Right.  Host: …it's just the new part is the NASA operations. So I wanted to get your perspective on the culture shock that hit you…    Nicole McElroy: Sure, sure. I think the, the cool and good thing is that, kind like you said, every control room is very similar in that, like, a control room needs to be very calm and very organized and very methodical about working through problems, and so sitting in the control room here is actually very similar than sitting in the control room at Virgin Orbit and I think most control rooms around all the different companies that are, are doing different mission operations. I think the cool part about NASA culture overall that I've experienced over the last couple months is just how collaborative it is, and it's really everybody's kind of working towards these bigger goals that really only NASA can be driving, kind of, as the point of pushing everything forwards, and kind of being able to see a, a bigger, bigger picture of like, what are we doing as the U.S. space programs and how do all of the different companies help support that? Whereas commercially, you're, you're trying to figure out what your part is in that bigger picture and, and get that mission accomplished; NASA is like driving a lot more of what that is and be able to integrate different people in different companies and work together.   Host: Interesting. Elias, you're hearing Nicole's word about the culture. You're very familiar with it, right? You've been over a decade in, in mission operations. Give us a sense of what that, for, for folks that may not be familiar with it, for especially, you know, Nicole who's entering into it and getting a feel for it, just what, what is that general culture that's, that's happening here?     Elias Myrmo: Yeah, I, I would say that I think operations does translate well to other areas that do operations, whether, military does operations all the time, obviously commercial spaceflight has been a burgeoning industry over the past ten, 15 years, so they have kind of the control rooms, the methodical pace, the marching through things. But I think, as kind of Nicole touched on, we really are the hub of human spaceflight for America, and really as America is, is the leaders in human spaceflight really around the world, it's like the only place in the world that you can kind of do this. Obviously, Russia and China have, have pieces to that, but we have decades of experience, we have an International Space Station that, that has been continuously crewed for the past two decades; we have commercial partners coming online and flying to the space station; we're about to launch the Artemis rocket to the Moon. And, and really all of those things creates this interesting collaborative culture. It's really pushing forward kind of what NASA's doing, again, with, with partners. We've had a lot of experience with international partners; I think that's probably unique to, to the commercial industry that Nicole comes from. Obviously, we have the Japanese, the Europeans and the Russians all working with us for the, for this common goal. I know folks talk a lot about the International Space Station should win a Nobel Peace Prize because it's the best example of, of really collaborative humanity doing something for the greater good that, that we have, and, and I think that's true. But now over the past ten years bringing on the commercial elements is also super-exciting, right?   Host: Yeah.   Elias Myrmo: So instead of having to rely on NASA spending billions of dollars to build this, this one rocket, now we've got, you know, three spacecraft that are, that are, that's human rated that are going to space, right, between Orion and Dragon and, and Starliner. That's never happened in the history of, of America, right? And we're on the, the precipice of, of I think just a really cool environment where we have easy access to space. We're going out to the Moon and, and flight operations, to pull it back to the culture stuff, is really pulling all of these different companies and, and government pieces and international partners together for this common good. Because at the end of the day the flight director is responsible for the crew and the vehicle safety, right? So it's our astronauts that are onboard these vehicles that are, that are taking these risks. And so that all comes back to the flight director leading this team to, to achieve these, these really awesome feats that, that we're about to go do.    Nicole McElroy: I was just going to say, I think a lot of that, too, kind of like, I'm sure we'll get into what does the job look like, but there's so many different projects that the Flight Director Office is working on that kind of represent that, right? There are representatives that are paying attention to SpaceX or Boeing or any of the other partners that we're working with and working to make sure that those missions are successful and safe. And it really kind of gives a interesting and cool diversity of the work that everybody's doing and how all of those things then can learn from each other and make sure that everything is successful overall.    Host: You guys have gotten a feel for it for, for many years before accepting the flight director position, you know, and flight director is of course a certain level of responsibility. In a sense, you almost kind of oversee this culture and enforce this culture, but you guys have been living it for, for quite some time. Ronak, just a sense of, I mean, you've been, you've been in mission control for quite some time; thinking about just that level of training and, and responsibility that comes every time you come into that room, something that you, that folks may not know about being a flight controller, when you walk into the room, you have sort of a certain mindset. What, what, how do you enter mission control?    Ronak Dave: Yeah, absolutely. I, I think there's a, a very solemn and awesome responsibility you're handed when you walk into that room. That goes down to the flight controller level, right? Every system's flight controller that walks in is given the keys to the space station and is given ultimate responsibility for their system, to make recommendations to the team to say, this is my system, I understand what's going on, there's something wrong with it, we need to take these steps to make sure that the crew and the vehicle stay safe and that we can continue to execute the mission. When you look across the board, you want all these systems experts who are given that responsibility to then inform the flight director, who has the risk-taking ability to say, OK, I understand what you all are saying; maybe we have this many problems, now I'm going to dictate that within the context of the rules we've been given and the agreements we have with the program, that we are going to go do these things in this order, and I understand it may not be the best for you and it may not be the best for you, but looking at, I'm going to say it again we'll probably say it a lot today -- the big picture -- which you may be the only person as a flight director looking at that big picture at that time, to give marching orders to say let's go execute this in this order to make sure that we're keeping the crew and the vehicle safe. And, and that responsibility and, and the onus of that is significant, and I don't think anyone takes that lightly. I can tell you for, even at the flight controller level, right, we do a lot of simulations and we train people very well. The first time you walk in there on your own and you take the console as a solo shift, you feel different, right? You, you're thinking different, your brain turns on and works over-clocked, you're running at 120%, and everything's calm, everything's methodical, right, but you're thinking differently, right? It, it, it is a different mindset and people deal with this differently, but for me it was absolutely a different mindset that you would walk in with where you have to be ready to respond to anything that day. And, and certainly that sort of mindset exists at the flight director console too, right? That every day you go in there, you're running a timeline, you might just be working on paperwork, you're getting ready for the next day, maybe the next complex op[eration], but at any moment in time something could happen in the most unforgiving environment where you have to go make sure that the crew stays safe.    Host: So what, tell me about the mix of the, when you talk about 120%, what's, what is it, is it a social thing, is it a, is it a speech thing, is it a technical thing? Is it a very powerful mix of all of those things?    Ronak Dave: Yeah, I'd say it's probably a mix, and it probably depends per, per person. I, I, these guys can probably tell you that when I'm just chatting with you, my voice sounds different on the loops. It's not something I do consciously, it just kind of happens. There's also just the thought processes, right? You're obviously doing your, your, what I'll call quote unquote, “housekeeping work,” right, making sure the console is operating, making sure that you're taking care of the paperwork that needs to do. But in the back of your head, you're always thinking about what could happen. And then if something happens, you're working on it and maybe something that happens all the time, but then you're also thinking about, well, what could happen now that makes this worse? And that's a, a process, if you will, that for me is constantly running. And, and there's…when, when I did sets of shifts, right, that's something that would last days and, and it will drain you. And that's something that we tell a lot of flight controllers in training is sim[ulation]s are draining; it's a long day. But when you get into the real control room with the real vehicle, it's a different level of kind of stress that you put your body through. And it's a different level of anxiety that you have to learn to harness to be able to work more efficiently.    Host: Garret, you're probably, you're listening to this mentality, I'm guessing, very similar things happening in your world.    Garrett Hehn: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I think it's something that we instill in flight operations very intentionally. I think there's a, a process: some of this is accumulated from experience, some of it is, you know, from actual psychology research, but the idea of how do you get that optimum performance and, you know, we have, we have some keywords, we have some tenets, that are just kind of little triggers for everyone about, you know, the responsibility required, how vigilant you have to be, you know, these are just some words that get thrown a lot around in MCC, you know. Even, we moved into our new offices and a lot of people have, you know, first thing they did, walked into that whiteboard and put “Tough and Competent” on the top of it. You know, and that has history all the way back to the Apollo 1 fire, because that's the sort of…that's the sort of community and internal foundation that we want to create. To me, it kind of, walking and going into MCC, I really like that Ronak said that it is, it's, it's different. You know, we try to make the sims as stressful as we can, but it is different when you're dealing with the real vehicle. I likened it, too, to swimming to athletics where you kind of want to find that flow, right? You want to find that middle ground of, you know, I'm, I'm feeling the stress, I'm putting it aside if it's, if it's not productive, and I'm, you know, making sure that my focus is in the right place and that I'm, I'm working the problem, right? That's another, you know, Gene Kranz-ism, right?  Host: Work the problem.  Garrett Hehn: Work the problem. Don't make it worse by trying to spin your wheels over something; you know, be methodical. And, you know, Nicole used that word too of, it's kind of universal to ops of the, the deliberate nature that you need to have. And sometimes that means slowing yourself down.   Host: Let's go around and talk about the flight director position, because we're getting a sense of the seriousness of the culture and of course you guys have been in the operation, all of you have been in the operations role for quite some time. But when you, I think this is a really good segue into talking about why you wanted to do this, because it's a very serious thing. It's a, and, and, you know, it takes a lot, you know, like even just hearing you guys, it's just like, gosh, this is stressful, right? [Laughter] But you guys want to take it on, right? So Elias, we'll go back to you for a second. It's just, you know, you said you wanted to, you talked about diversifying your experiences and, and getting, going out of your comfort zone and something is, is the flight director just naturally that next step? What really made you want to pursue being a flight director?    Elias Myrmo: Yeah. I mean, I think I always wanted to be a flight director from when I saw “Apollo 13” because it was, it was kind of this role that's leading this team of technical experts solving hard problems in space. Love space, love space shuttle, all that stuff. But then really the, the problem-solving aspects to it were fascinating watching “Apollo 13” and all of the problems that they had to work through and methodically working through them and, and saving the astronauts, right? So that was always the kind of the goal. And then the career path really was the diversity of experiences to kind of set me up to, to hopefully be a good flight director with, with kind of those backgrounds, to understand kind of what CRONUS does and how they fight problems versus how a trajectory officer will fight problems, and how going in the Moon is different than hanging out in LEO (low-Earth orbit). So all of those things I think culminated in, in kind of just a, a good resume for, for flight director. But I would say that path was also a lot of fun. Again, I got to solve problems as a CRONUS for the space station, whether they were computer, computer failures or camera failures, as the case may be, to, to really helping develop all of the, the plans and procedures we're using for, for Artemis I from a trajectory standpoint. So having a hand in all of this development as we go back to the Moon was super-exciting, but then also kind of shaped, I think, how I'll become a flight director, right, because I have, I've got some of technical knowledge here but also just the process in which you go about solving problems and operations, which I think is, is really probably the key that we all have experiences doing that around this table. And, and that's, that's super-important. And then the other piece too just added the culture, like Garrett talked about some of the foundations, but one of the other foundations of, of flight operations is really to be unexpectedly put in a situation where your actions have the ultimate consequences, where the crew is really dependent on you and you, you don't know when you're about to see the board light up with a bunch of emergencies and, and warnings and, and things that are threatening the crew on the space station. And, and that's kind of, we talk about the stress level in that and it's the fact that that can happen at any time. And as a flight controller, you know, I'm watching my system kind of ready to, to react to those things. Obviously as a flight director, you're, you're opening your, your lens, your field of view, even further to be able to respond to those things. And, and while that probably sounds stressful to lots of people, really being in the situation to help the crew to, to kind of work the team through these problems, is, is what's appealing about that, that position.    Host: Do you think there's a uniform approach to the personality traits of a flight director, or do you think each person has their…you guys are smiling; every, you got, well you've worked with a lot of flight directors, right, so everybody's sort of unique.    Elias Myrmo: I, I, I think one thing, getting into the office, one thing that they've, they've kind of told us, which I think is very true after watching a lot of flight directors, is much of the office, really the whole office, office of flight directors, will get to the same answer about something, but the path that they take will look completely different, pretty much for every individual, about how they approach it, their biases, their experiences, how they'll try to solve these things. So while, while there's consistency in that, that model of how you get to the, the end goal, how you get there, I think, is colored by the, the vast diversity of experiences and personalities that we have inside of the office.    Garrett Hehn: And I think the simplest way that I can think of putting it is leadership has to be genuine. And so everybody has a different genuine style, it's got to work for who they are, because, you know, our flight controllers are, are humans and they're not going to respond to somebody putting on airs or trying to be something that they're not. So it, you know, that's sort of part of our training that is definitely a, a topic, we as the newest class talk about a lot of, you know, what are these different styles? What, what works? And we've been encouraged by the veteran flight directors of, you know, part of this process is figuring that out and trying new styles, and seeing, you know, how do people respond when you use a different method to arrive at that answer.  Ronak Dave: And part of that is if you're in one of those emerging scenarios, right, if you're in a, a fast-developing, changing, high-stress environment, you're going to download to who you really are. So you can try and put on a face and be different, but one of the biggest pieces of advice I got trying to get into this process of applying was just be yourself, because at the end of the day the office and the chief flight director, it is their duty to trust you, and that trust is what puts you on console. And they trust who you are, and in making those decisions you have to be yourself because when it gets hairy, right, that's what you're going to become. So that, that was a, a something that I really thought about and, and think about today, right, of you can't try to think about things differently because you are a new person now, or this is your, your job is different, and people look at you differently. You have to be able to be yourself all the time.      Host: But it's kind of like, like in an add, it's kind of like the best version of yourself almost, right? It's, it's still yourself, but you come in, like, from a preparatory standpoint, like you kind of have the knowledge and everything, but you also sort of have the best understanding of yourself and the best mentality.    Ronak Dave: Yeah. That, that's a, a great note, Gary, because that's something we've explicitly talked about as well. So you, you want to be yourself, right, but that doesn't mean you can't improve yourself. And you can't become the best part of yourself. And some of that means you need to understand your weaknesses, you need to understand your biases, so that when I'm asking questions of someone, I know that, well, I would think about it this way but I, I am colored by other opinions or thoughts or prior knowledge of a system. But you need to be able to acknowledge that when you have those conversations, and in using that becoming the best version of yourself.   Host: Is that sort of what led you to apply to be a flight director, was taking that next step, being the best version of yourself, or maybe it was more natural than that?  Ronak Dave: Yeah, no, I, I think that was part of it, maybe from a different perspective. I started my career in ISS working in the attitude determination control officer console position, so making sure we're orienting the, the ISS the correct way. And in that I, I started training and getting certified just as a flight controller, and, and when you start right, you're just slamming shifts -- you're working a lot of console and you become very proficient at flying the spacecraft and doing what you need to do to keep us flying around the Earth. Once you start doing that, you also start to pick up these projects, right, and, and open your lens of getting into more complex things: how do I go catch this Dragon spacecraft and attach it to the station, what new operations can we do to improve how we fly the space station? And that started to shift my focus, right, of from that position looking at the bigger position of, bigger picture, of what are the small things we can do to improve how we operate this vehicle? Moving into the propulsion world, where I started to pick up CST-100, Orion and, and SLS, there the lens got even bigger, right, where I'm now working with commercial partners and, and helping integrate different parts of a program and talking to people from different centers and, and realizing that operationally, when the clock hits T-zero, we are the ones who are responsible for everything that has to do with smoke and fires or brains on a rocket, which means I need to know everything. I also need to know how that connects to the Orion spacecraft. And really, if you look around the landscape of all the people developing this hardware, they are acknowledged, they acknowledge the fact that they have to interface with these different vehicles and that's a part of their requirements and what they design to, but when you think about problem-solving across the entire thing, we are kind of the big picture thinkers that are connecting all those dots. So seeing how I could help folks in designing this, this spacecraft and the rocket to connect those dots earlier, so that when we get to flying it it makes our life easier and it’s safer for the crew, that's where I really started to open up the landscape and see that the, the job we do as operators and really as flight directors is not just the technical, right, it's a lot about building relationships and a team so that not just when we're in the operational arena but when we're leading up to it, when we're planning, we're training, we're developing new vehicles, that we can work with all these teams and make sure that we emphasize why our point of view is important and how that impacts designs and how those things are usually not just good for the crew safety and, and how we operate a vehicle, but are generally more integrated as, as design philosophies and, and then end up with better vehicles as such. And that's what kind of got me to, well, hang on, like I'm making a difference at this level, right, so could I leverage that to make a difference at a higher level?    Nicole McElroy: And I think the cool part about what he touched on, right, like we talked a lot about the execution side of the flight director role, but there was also a lot of the planning and pre-coordination part of the flight director role that is working with those same teams but way earlier in the processes such that you have that relationship built and also have all those plans and everyone's vetted it through early on, but the flight directors are still pretty crucial in leading those efforts as well as leading the on-console execution.    Host: Nicole, do you feel like you have an extra challenge because these guys have been in the world for so long? Do you feel like you have to play catch-up a little faster, or do you feel like, like the training is sort of…    Nicole McElroy: Sure. No, the, definitely I’m playing catch-up on the language, I guess I would say…  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Nicole McElroy: …and, like, the experience, right? Like, we are in classes right now and there's a lot of work to just understand how the ISS works and functions and how the systems do what they need to do that a lot of the rest of the class already has, right? Like, they've been experts on those systems before and operated them and understand what people in different console seats have also been doing. So I'm definitely trying to catch up there, but it has been interesting in a way that as I learn things from scratch here, I have a different reference frame of a different system that's worked somewhere else and that allows me to maybe bring in questions that kind of come at things a little bit sideways, and kind of ask questions that every now and then I challenge the knowledge of the class and like make people think about it a little bit differently. And then as a group we can kind of have a more collective understanding.    Host: Do you guys see that when you're in classes together, like Nicole is bring in a new perspective?    Garrett Hehn: It's a total asset to our, to our learning, even of us who have been here for a while to have that fresh perspective. You know, Nicole and Diana [Trujillo] as well coming from external to Johnson [Space Center] bring a angle that either we don't see or sometimes you take for granted, right? And so there's definitely been times where, you know, Nicole's asking a question and I'm like, I think I know the answer and then the instructor answers and I go, I did not know. [Laughter]  Host: Because to Ronak’s point, like this is probably going to be the new normal, right, have, needing this perspective, needing the perspective of commercial industry. If you're talking, if you're working with commercial industry now, Ronak, I mean that's, that's like, you have to understand that mentality and having a person, especially your perspective, Nicole, having like that here to kind of bring into NASA's culture and be like, wow, this is, this is expanding, this is growing, you know, NASA's, NASA's influence. Elias, you talked about NASA's influence being sort of like an international thing, but, but having, bringing on new perspectives has just got to be super-valuable.    Elias Myrmo: And I think really changing your perspective, even coming out of a flight control discipline to flight director, is super-important. So like when I was a CRONUS, like the power system would fail and then my camera -- I'll keep going back to cameras -- my camera would fail, then I wouldn't have a camera. And so that's all I cared about, and I understood that connection. But then, like going through the training as a flight director, clearly I care more about than CRONUS’ camera, right?   Host: Yeah.   Elias Myrmo: So I think all of us are going through this perspective change and, and having Nicole, and then Diana as well from JPL, come in with these other questions, to, to really start to poke at the different perspectives that you really need as a flight director. I think more than anything, a flight director understands how to work a problem, right? Like, I might not have the technical knowledge of the widget that you're, you're working on with the problem, but you know how to attack the problem and figure out what the next worst failure is, what the risk to crew is, what the risk of the mission is, and, and really being able to articulate those questions to get the information at your team is vitally important, right? So having these other perspectives, shifting our perspective, that's really, probably, I don't know, at least half the training as a flight director that, that I feel like we've done so far, is just getting your mind to think differently.   Host: Well, let's get into the training. I, I feel like it's probably, it's probably interesting, you're probably getting a whole new perspective. I mean, like, Garrett, we'll start with you because you, you've spent a lot of time as a flight controller, now you're taking flight director training. Talk about some of the things that you guys are, are starting off with.  Garrett Hehn: Right. And so, we're a, we're pretty heavy in classroom, classroom lessons at this point. And I think one of the most exciting things to me is that a lot of the basis of the training we're receiving is the same training the crew gets, right, because we have a lot of similarity in terms of the perspective of what we need to know, right? Crew is the one in the seats on the vehicle, and so they need that broad knowledge; so we do as well, and we also need to understand what the crew knows because they, you know, are the most important system on board as the human system. And then I think that the second part that has got me most excited for these classroom lessons is the people that teach us, and, you know, they're oftentimes the top flight controllers in whatever their expertise is, so you really are getting knowledge from the absolute expert -- and in some cases, the world -- just there to teach you, which is, it's humbling, it's incredible, it's really exciting to go to work when you get to do that.   Host: Wow. So you, so is it, is it really just, you're getting a sense so, Ronak you talked about having to rely on like each of the different positions; is it really, you're getting to know that position super-well so you know the questions to ask in the, in the moment where you need, when you need to?    Ronak Dave: Yeah, that's part of it. And it's not just the flight control positions, but like Garrett mentioned the, one of the biggest members of our team is the crew as well, right? So before this podcast, actually, a few of us were over in the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility starting our emergency training flow, which is the same emergency training flow that the astronauts would get. So we were putting on gas masks and stuff that you'd use to breathe oxygen in the case of a fire or a toxic atmosphere or emergency, so getting that same kind of hands on with the hardware so that when we hear down from the crew and they're saying they're having an issue with XYZ piece of hardware, I've put my hands on it, right, I know how hard it is to untorque that bolt, how, how the structure may interfere with it and why they may be having trouble yanking this box out of a rack, right? So it's a really good perspective building exercise in more than just the information, but having the perspective of, hey, we, we know why you're having trouble with that connector; I've put my hands on that connector, it's really hard to undo and redo. And, and being able to help with the Capcom talk through that and with the experts who own that hardware, we may be the three people in the room that have done that one thing. So that, that has been a really insightful piece of the puzzle for me.  Host: Interesting. Elias, you, you talked about you've wanted to be this, a flight director for quite some time. I wonder if part of the training is hearing from flight directors, hearing from some of the historic, like, well-known heroes and stuff, like, have you gotten to talk to, you know, his, like Gene Kranz and some of the folks that are still around from the Apollo era or any of those?    Elias Myrmo: Yeah. So we've actually got to meet Gene Kranz; we didn't get to talk to him extensively, but we actually have [Rob] Kelso, who was a flight director in the 80s coming and talk to us.  Host: Cool.   Elias Myrmo: So yeah, that's another cool thing about the culture, generically, right, is flight operation has been around since the 60s…   Host: Yeah.   Elias Myrmo: …and we can trace our lineage directly to that. When I was the group leader of the FDOs I actually had the paper logs from the Apollo missions that the FDOs had written from Apollo 11 and 13, and right, like, they wrote, they had these handwritten logs about the explosion going off and, and this, that, and the other thing. And so, being able to tap into those resources is incredibly valuable and, and they're more than happy to share their experiences, especially as, as Artemis gets stood up. Gerry Griffin, actually, who was also the, the center director for JSC at some point in the history, was also Gold Flight. We all have our names, right? So gold, there used to be colors, now they're, you know…   Host: Everything. [Laughter]  Elias Myrmo: …everything.  Garrett Hehn:  We ran out of colors.  Elias Myrmo: We ran out of colors. So when you, when you hear a flight director has, like, one of the primary colors or one of the few colors, they're like, oh, you must have been, you know, one of the guys, right? And so he was on for some of the lunar landers. And as we were kind of even building the flight control team for Artemis and as we look forward being able to talk to him, this was back when I was actually the FDO group lead, but, but they're more than happy to share those experiences and why they made decisions like they did. So that's, that's incredibly valuable. The whole office too, offers up kind of the same kind of stuff. So there's 30 flight directors right now; obviously, there's lots of experience of, of recent flight directors of, of dealing with failures on, on console, working through problems, bringing commercial entities online. Obviously, you know, the, our recent history's been pretty dynamic with just, again, all of the stuff that's coming online.  Host: Right.  Elias Myrmo: So, so they're more than happy to, to talk to us and, and share their thoughts and wisdoms, which is again, culturally super-important for flight operations. As a flight controller, I did the same thing as I trained new flight controllers; it's, it's the same thing in the flight director office. So passing that knowledge down is really one of the key things that even us as flight directors kind of have to carry that mantle that, that we really trace our lineage right back to, to Chris Kraft, right? So…  Host: Yeah.  Elias Myrmo: …it's, it's super-important.    Host: I wonder how much you pull from the past and how much you look at some of the current folks and then, thinking about that and then the future, right? Because obviously, there's a lot of stuff in the past that you want to learn from. And there's, there's, you, we're, we're lucky enough to be in a time where, like, you have the original flight directors that you get to talk to; that's, that's pretty special. But it is, you know, was like 60 years later, like 50-plus -- how, how close are we? ‘65 was when, was when MCC was first occupied? So, we're close. We're coming up on, yeah, we're, we're, we're getting close on 60 years. So that's a long time. But, but, mission control has evolved. So I wonder from your perspective, Nicole we'll start with you, your perspective on understanding the roots of mission control, how it's evolved and kind of like where this new class might take it in the future. We talked about commercial entities and learning, and its, mission control is growing, we have international commercial partners; talk about that evolution.    Nicole McElroy: Yeah, no, that's an interesting question because a lot of it kind of coming in, right, like, it's amazing how many different resources and how much history there is, right, like that I'm kind of coming into, and kind of coming in with all of it just kind of from scratch is really, like, exemplified of, like, how many different places there are that I could go ask someone specifically for information or find that system expert and just have that wealth of information and history available to you, which is amazing. But kind of as we evolve and move it forward, I think there's a balance of, like, trying to, like, balance both your time, right, like, and you as a person on, like, not getting too caught up in all the history, but still knowing the key takeaways and the important things to use to build on to go forward. So trying to find that right balance of not, you could spend forever, right, like historians do and we're not historians for a reason, right? So, like, finding that balance of how much of that information to pull on that then I can directly apply to the things I'm doing today and then the things I'm doing tomorrow. And the kind of cool thing is, right, like there have been various phases of human spaceflight, so there's been transitions like this before, and so trying to look at those as well in order to say, OK, how did that transition go and how did they apply things and how can we mirror that or improve upon it, is something that I could see.   Host: I want to pull on your knowledge too, Ronak on, on this specific topic because of, you said you worked, you work, support, Space[X], you've worked Starliner, you worked, there's like a lot of different, and, and with that comes not just a mission control focus, like, you're working hand in hand with, like, the Boeing guys, right? And which of course, they're, they're pulling on a lot of NASA folks, but still, I mean there's a, there's a culture shift. Do you, do you see it and how do you pull from the, same, same question, how do you pull from the past and kind of mix it in with what's going on now?    Ronak Dave: Yeah, so I, I think that we in operations, and NASA in general, emphasizes lessons learned, right? We, we fly these vehicles and fly these missions to explore, but as a part of that is learning not just about whatever those mission objectives are, but about the vehicles themselves. There were things we were learning about the space shuttle on its final flight. So that's a process that never stops. That could be at the lowest level of, hey, if you run this prop[ulsion] system at this pressure, these things happen; or it could be, hey, when you're planning a mission, maybe avoid these months because you have these effects, right? And those are just general examples. But, carrying those across from Apollo and what we learn there and planning lunar missions now, or, or like you're alluding to, Gary, of having different commercial crew providers and, and making sure that we're looking at those operations across the fleet of vehicles that we're working on and see how this thing that we learned may impact everything else, that's something we actively do today. We're, we're taking any learning points we get from one vehicle and, and making sure that we at least evaluate those on the others. And yeah, they may not apply, but if there's something we learned that could have a detrimental effect somewhere else, that's absolutely something we want to make sure that we evaluate on those other systems.   Host: Let's go back to training for a second. Garrett, I want to go to, to you for a second because we're, we're talking about training; I want to know sort of what the flow is until you actually are in the hot seat, right?   Garrett Hehn: OK.  Host: What are some of the, what are some of the things you have to go through until like day one, you're on console and you get your own call sign and everything, and what's, what's that going to look like?  Garrett Hehn: Yeah, I mentioned earlier that we're, we're pretty heavy into classroom content at this point. And I think the, one of the major switches is when we get into simulations, or sims. And so, we touched on them a little bit earlier; I think Ronak talked about it in his training flow. It's just like the flight controllers, and the purpose is to try to create as high-fidelity environment as you can, and then experience those failures to test your response. And really that's your, when you're in sims the idea is you're walking in with all the requisite technical knowledge, all the skills already, and it's really just, just proving it, right? And then also, the integrated fashion, right; it's an incredibly unique training tool in terms of you’re getting a full team, in many circumstances, all together to try to see how can we learn how to work with each other, and how can we perfect, you know, leveraging all parts of the team. So that is, and is often kind of your, your final step; there's an evaluation associated with those simulations, and, you know, we'll have, each of us will have a handful of those sims and then with that evaluation comes a, you know, a sign-off from the chief of the Flight Director Office that says, yes, you are ready and we, you've gained our trust. And I'd say that's probably, the early of us, earliest of us you might see would be early next year.    Host: OK. All right. I'll be looking for your call signs. Do you guys have that, do you have yours picked out yet, or no, you're going to hold on to…  Ronak Dave: It, it, it, you know, it's funny you say that, Gary. It was in our to-do list that they kind of gave us when we started, they were like, start thinking of a call sign. You may think it's one of the least important things that you're going to do with all this technical stuff you have to go learn over the next year or so, but it's probably going to be the hardest decision you make because that's what people are going to know you even after you retire. So.  Elias Myrmo: And all the colors are gone. [Laughter]  Garrett Hehn: And it's a tough, it's a tough bar now to clear. I mean, some of the previous ones from the last couple classes, they're super, super-meaningful. They set the tone for what they're going to be like in the room.   Host: Yeah.  Garrett Hehn: So it's no joke.    Host: Yeah. You have to really put a lot. I'll be, I'll be looking forward to it. I'll be interested to hear. It's going to be an interesting time when you guys start coming on, right? I mean, by that time, we're, we're, we're looking to, we're going to be in Artemis missions, you got Commercial Crew missions, you got private missions. I mean, this is, this is a very dynamic and interesting time. Elias, when you, when you start, what is the breadth of what you're about to take on? Are you going to take it on all at once? You going to start on ISS and then just sort of work your way around? What's the, what's the plan?  Elias Myrmo: Yeah, so, so ISS ends up being a, a great training opportunity for new flight directors and, and new flight controllers too. It's, it's up there 365. So the, the first year you really, they call it burn-in where you'll work probably 80 shifts in the first year. So, really just to get that real time experience, because obviously, sims is, is a skillset, but then actually dealing with the real vehicle and real crews is, is different, right? We talked about kind of the stress level that goes up of, of really them depending on you at, at any time. And then also working through kind of the, the real time challenges, which are a little bit different than, everything's, everything's failing in the sim; now, now you've got a timeline and you've got this payload that, that has gone wonky and the crew's way late on it and you’re kind of working on kind of timeline triage. So it's different skill sets that you learn. After that, there's obviously the cargo missions and the crewed missions for, that go to the space station; I would say those are kind of the, the first lead tasks that a flight director will get. Again, kind of to now you've got a dedicated team, you've got a dynamic operation, working through all of the plans and procedures for that. After that, you've got, you get into EVAs (extravehicular activities), you get into, we, we support the Starliner missions kind of being flight directors over there; we support the Artemis missions. So it kind of really opens up probably after the first couple years. Once again, you've built that, you know, set of shifts with ISS where, where you're really learning how to be the flight director, right? You can be certified in sims, but until you actually work a bunch of shifts in real time, it's just a, a different experience set, right?    Host: Seems like it follows like risk and novelty, right? So, like, there's, like, the general stuff and then it gets, you know, a little more risky with cargo, not so much, and then obviously you're going to be working visiting vehicles with humans on it, and then you've got novel missions like Artemis where everything is like, it's going to be…  Elias Myrmo: It's all new.  Host: …it's all new, right? So yeah, just sort of, it sounds like that's what you do. You sort of work your way up the chain. Very interesting. Now, wanted to sort end with this idea of just, kind of building off of that, this idea of how dynamic it is, but the sort of how you're approaching it in, in a sense of taking on that responsibility, but also a certain level of excitement too, because this is pretty cool. You guys are, you guys are flight directors. That's awesome. I mean, that's a really exciting time. Nicole, we'll start with, with you. I mean, you're, you're entering into a really cool and dynamic time in human spaceflight history. What are just some of the feel, I mean, you're, you're a flight director now and you're going to be that person on console, so what are some of your feelings, your…   Nicole McElroy: Oh my gosh, it's totally 100% excitement and then 10% of everything else stacked on top, but just kind of seeing all the different things that are happening in the human spaceflight sphere at the moment, as you kind of mentioned, and really as we're working towards Artemis and putting people back on the Moon and then using that to launch towards Mars and really kind of just seeing how everything's really building on each other, I'm just thrilled to be getting involved in getting the opportunity to kind of start with it now and be able to see all of that evolve and kind of be there for every step along the way.    Host: That's awesome. Elias, same feelings of excitement? You've been thinking about this for a long time. Your…    Elias Myrmo: Yeah. Total excitement and as I was talking about before, there's three capsules that we're working on flying, right? And then you have the cargo vehicles, and you've got Dream Chaser that Sierra Nevada is working on. Obviously, you've got Northrop Grumman with Cygnus. Like, you've just got this plethora of vehicles, where when I grew up with a space shuttle, right, and, and then the Russians have the Soyuz, and that was about it. So now the fact that you've just got just all of these things going on, right, and then also, when I first came out here in 2005 as an intern, the space station was, you know, still getting built and we got to Assembly Complete in my career, and now, you know, we're, we're doing tons of science, we've got DNA sequencers and ultrasounds and all this stuff on, on ISS, right, that's, that's continuously crewed. So just being able to, to lead the team, even just in day-to-day operations of supporting this magnificent vehicle that we put in LEO, right, is, is really something I'm looking forward to, especially after working Artemis for about five years. Artemis is amazing: that's going to be super-fun to go back to the Moon. But what, ISS I think is, is always has a special place in my heart to, to be able to support. So I'm, I'm super-excited to, to do that next year.    Host: I think part of the reason they brought on a new flight, class of flight directors -- obviously they do it like every couple of years -- but man, they need you guys. [Laughter] There's so much going on and like the demands just sound so, I mean, it's, it's very demanding. Like you mentioned, right, as, as a flight director, you know, 20-something years ago, you had to learn the space shuttle, you maybe had to learn the space station, right? Now, you have to learn all of these different commercial, I mean, there's a lot, there's a lot to absorb, right? It's just, it sounds very challenging. Yeah.    Elias Myrmo: There's a lot going on. It's a great time to be in space though, whether you're at NASA, whether you're in private, I mean, it's just, it's, it's blowing up as a, as an industry, right? We've got tons of companies that are going to LEO, not just for human spaceflight but for everything. And as just a space nerd, right, like, again, 20 years ago we had expendable launch vehicles, the space shuttle, and that was about it. And now, like, everywhere, every day I see like a new startup that's going, oh, we're going to go to LEO and take like 50 kilograms and do all this cool stuff in space. And it's just, it's awesome.  Host: Yeah. What a time. You excited too, Garrett?     Garrett Hehn: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I have a, a very trajectory nerd milestone in my mind of, Artemis I, when it launches, I want to see the, you know, I'm, I'm not going to be able to work that mission, right -- Elias laid out our kind of, our burn-in for ISS -- but I plan to be in the, in the, in the control center in the viewing area for when we take Orion further than any other man-rated spacecraft has been before. Just going to be a random point in space; it's, you know, I'm sure there'll be a beautiful view of the stars, but to me, I feel like that's a pretty awesome statement of intent of where we're going and that we're kind of pushing the crew, human spaceflight element further than we've gone before. And some of that, a lot of that, right, starts with ISS and we use ISS as a platform to try to help us get further. But, yeah, I'm looking forward to most just being a part of that team that gets to take humanity further than we've ever been.    Host: Oh, beautiful. Ronak, follow that. [Laughter]   Ronak Dave: Yeah, I know. [Laughter] So I mean, I think we've all talked about it personally, right? We're extremely excited, humbled to have a opportunity where, I mean, like Elias mentioned, right, this is something I've wanted to do since grade school, but it's also one of those jobs that you can't be angry about not getting, right? So I think we're very humbled to have the opportunity to go lead these teams and missions to go back to the Moon, to utilize ISS to the fullest extent of its capability, to help set up the infrastructure to go put boots on Mars. And all, doing all of that while helping to burgeon the LEO environment and help bring our commercial partners out to the Moon with us, and really do that at a national and international level. Part of that excitement is also, I mean, we have a great team and, Gary, the, you and the public affairs officers (PAOs) are a big part of that, right, making sure that we are spreading that vision and what we're doing and those beautiful pictures we take with the rest of the, the nation and the world to, to show that, hey, look, this is what we're exploring, right? This is, you, you go up and fly to the International Space Station, you look out of the Cupola and it's just Earth, and that's all of us. And making sure that we spread that message with, with your help is a great deal, a great part of that excitement as well. And, and soon, those will be pictures of, of the Moon. So I think that part of it is definitely exciting as well.    Host: Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. This was so fun to be talking to you guys. You're [a] very energetic group; you got a lot to learn, a lot to do, but this has been super-awesome talking to you guys. Best of luck in your training. Be gentle to your PAOs. Take care guys. Thanks.  All: Thanks, Gary.  [Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around; had a really good conversation with the new class of flight directors today. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 87, Twins Study. I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA. So, today we're talking about one of the more famous studies conducted here at NASA in recent years. It's called the Twins Study. You may remember from March 2015 to March 2016; now former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly spent a year in space with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. The One-Year Mission was to investigate just what you think, what happens to the human body during and after a year in microgravity. At the same time, another study was being conducted with Scott Kelly, but this one brought in his twin brother Mark Kelly, also a former NASA astronaut. This investigation, called the Twins Study, examined what happened to both Scott Kelly in space and Mark Kelly on earth during the same period of time. It was a dense study, packed with 10 different investigations, 12 universities, different corporations and government laboratories, all looking at the more subtle changes that may occur within the human body during a long duration space-flight. So, with us to discuss the intricate details and even some of the recently published findings of this investigation is Dr. Andy Feinberg and Dr. Steve Platts. Dr. Feinberg is the principal investigator of one element of the Twins Study looking at epigenetics. We'll get into what that means in this episode. He's based at Johns Hopkins University, in the school of medicine. Dr. Platts is based here at the Johnson Space Center as the deputy chief scientist of the human research program. The program that sponsors the whole Twins Study. So, with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Andy Fienberg and Dr. Steve Platts. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Steve and Andy, thank you so much for coming on to talk about this Twins Study. There's a lot of interesting stuff here, and it's a very dense topic, so I appreciate you both coming on.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Really glad to do it.  Host: Alright, I think this is such a popular things because it is something that is sort of easy to grasp, right? You hear Twins Study, you know there are twins involved, one person in space, one person on the ground. It's something that is easy for people to sort of wrap their minds around, and you know, we did this big communications package when it was happening, so it was just something that people just got. But what's interesting is that the amount of research that's going into this is so dense and so widespread, and even just talking with Steve just before the podcast even started, he was saying, he showed me a picture of the opening to the article, or to the paper itself.  Dr. Steve Platts: Yep.  Host: And how many authors are a part of this. This is a very dense study.  Dr. Steve Platts: Yep. Huge undertaking.  Host: [Laughs] Very huge. So, before we get into that, before we get into the juicy details, I kind of wanted to pull back and start from the beginning, because I'm sure there is a sort of entrance point to when the Twins Study even started being a topic of possibilities. So, Steve, kick us off; where did this begin?  Dr. Steve Platts: Sure, it's kind of funny actually. You know, one of our goals is to go to Mars, and to get to Mars and get back home, it's going to be roughly three years. And so we knew we had to spend more time on the space station, we need more experience with longer duration missions in space. And so, we developed with our Russian counterparts this One-Year Mission program where we had one US astronaut, and one Russian cosmonaut who would do one year in space. And so we were, you know, talking that with people and our former chief scientist, John Charles, was on stage with Scott Kelly one day, and they were talking to an audience. And then on their way off of the podium, Scott turned to John and said, so, you remember that my twin brother is also an astronaut, so what are you going to do about that? And that was sort of the big ah-ha moment. It's like, wow we have to take advantage of this. And so that began a frenzy of how do we pull together a program, how do we get this stuff going? We did these rapid response grants, we had some people who knew geneticists. Because we wanted it to be a pathfinder study, where we did something we've never done before, where we really start to do genetic analysis the right way. And this was our entry into it. And so we pulled it together. We got 10 separate investigator teams, and within each team are some, you know, investigators on their own. In fact, we would call them the Gang of Ten because we have, you know, these powerful ten groups all coming together. They all came to JSC, we had working groups, we had folks decide, okay, I'm going to do this, you're going to share; the intellectual generosity between the teams was amazing. You know, you hear often for research like this where people are closely guarding their data, and you know, they don't want to share, they don't want people to see what they're doing. And this group was like okay, let's go, and they're just sharing all of this. So, it's just stunning really, the amount of work that we could do in such a short period of time. And, you know, we talk about the One-Year Mission, and the Twins Study was one year, but think about it; we had to start a year before to do data collection, and then we went for almost a year afterwards for data collection. So, it's really more of a three-year study than a one-year study, and Twins was a major, major part of that project.  Host: Now, that is fascinating that the Twins Study came up even after the One-Year Mission was a thing. Literally pulling John Charles aside and saying hey, there's a twin involved, you know, that we can do something with this, what are we going to do? And then that's when really things kicked off. I thought, you know, for sure it would have been something beforehand but, you know, why not? There's an opportunity here, let's take advantage of this.  Dr. Steve Platts: Absolutely, yep.  Host: And as you said, let's bring in all these people, and do the maximum amount of research that we possibly can. So, you said there's ten different things, and we could totally get into all of that. But I did want to start with, there is a difference, right, between One-Year Mission and Twins Study, they are separate investigations. Same time-frame, but they're different.  Dr. Steve Platts: Yes. So, really, it's the Twins Study was tacked onto the One-Year Mission. So, there were other, many other studies going on besides the Twins Study on the One-Year Mission. But the Twins Study was a major part of the science that was done. In fact, just a few kind of quick facts about that One-Year Mission; so, we launched in March of 2015 and landed in March of 2016, not quite a full year, but if you go on to Google you'll see Commander Kelly up there with a sign that says, you know, 350 days, close enough for government work. So, it was close, but not there. But, think about this, during this One-Year Mission, they travelled 143,846,525 miles. [Laughter] I mean, just amazing, right? And we did over 751 hours of HRP research during the One-Year Mission, and the Twins Study was a large part of that, but as you had said, it wasn't the entire package.  Host: Right, okay, so those miles traveled is how many laps around the earth?  Dr. Steve Platts: Many, many, many.  Host: Yeah.  Dr. Steve Platts: It's 5440 orbits.  Host: Oh, you have the number.  Dr. Steve Platts: I do.  Host: Unbelievable.  Dr. Steve Platts: Yep.  Host: Unbelievable. Yeah, that's, I mean, think about it, what is it, 16 sunrises and sunsets per day every 90 minutes, so that's going to, that's going to add up, and a lot of science, a lot of human science, right?  Dr. Steve Platts: Absolutely, yes.  Host: That was, like you said.  Dr. Steve Platts: That was just human research program with the over 750 hours.  Host: Unbelievable.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: I would like to add something to what Steve just said about the nature of how we came together looking at it from the view of an outside scientist if I could. So, what would NASA, from our point of view, so, people, we all have this experience, people would write to us and say, you know, you probably don't follow the, you know, the NASA news feed, but they have a solicitation to look at these identical twins. And, you know, later we got the backstory about how Scott himself, you know, suggested that there might be something pretty useful to do and then John Charles picked up on this right away. So, we entered this competition because from our point of view we thought that it would be very interesting to look at the fact that these are identical twins, they have the same genome, we're interested in that, but genetics, I'll come back to that in just a minute, because I want to just say something about the process. And it would be a really worthwhile and really unique opportunity to ask a question like this. But, regarding what Steve said about the cooperation among the scientists, he's right. I mean, when we're out doing a regular science, by definition it's very competitive. I mean, we're like nice people and we actually share data and all of that, but you know somebody publishes something before you do, and in general science, right, it's going to be hard for you to get your data published. The same thing with grants, so you're always in this forced competition because of limited resources. That is not how any of us approached the NASA work. To us, it was, here is this amazing opportunity to be part of what I think is the greatest science project in the history of mankind, that is turning eventually, started before I was born, and it's going to end long after I'm gone, and it's turning human beings from a terrestrial species into an interplanetary species. I'm not saying anything about colonization, I mean, you're not supposed to say that. But, you know, just in terms of exploration, right? And, it's such a large thing that's bigger than ourselves. And also, it's this amazing product of our government. I mean, you know, I'm a big fan of government science. I mean, it's amazing what the federal government can do and in cooperation with other countries to ask really big questions that can't be asked on a small scale by, you know, private research foundations, or even, really, industry because there's this fundamental drive for knowledge that's associated with this kind of research and it's been incorporated from the very early stage into NASA, this whole idea about human effects, and so forth. So, it's a privilege for us to do this, and it's a much larger thing than any one of us. And, I'll tell you the practical consequence of this is, we had this opening several days where we got, we knew we were getting funded, but we had our organizational meeting where we had to work out the details of the experiments, but then also NASA started out by having this thing, we all got into the auditorium, there were a couple of astronauts that we wound up interacting with that were like watching the whole thing. And they wanted to know, like, okay, how's, what's the authorship list? What's the publication rules? And this whole list of things that you'll see in big projects, you know, if you're doing, you know, outside research. And very quickly we said, we're one group, we're all in together, whatever is best for the interest of the group is what we're going to do, when we publish it's going to be a joint thing from our group. And, let's get to work now, let's spend this extra time you allotted for all this politics, which we're not interested in, and let's get right down to how we're going to do these studies. So, what we did, we just worked incredibly closely together to figure out, like, how are you going to get this material? I mean, the amount of blood that you can get from an astronaut in space is very tightly controlled by the operations people, and it's less blood than you would draw from a child who's in the hospital. And, I mean, there are a lot of reasons for this, but you know, you have to work within those parameters. And there're very strict rules in terms of how it can be collected and what was done with it immediately, and so forth. And we had, just like Steve said, many different kinds of investigators. I mean, people studying genetics and epigenetics, but then people studying the chromosomes and people studying the biochemistry, and so, there's a lot of different things. If you were on the ground doing something like this, you'd have a tube for genetics, you'd have a tube for chromosomes, you'd have a tube for biochemistry, literally. They're completely different. And chemistry is another one. So, we couldn't do that. We had to figure out exactly how we do things like, the minimum number of tubes, and the minimum volume, and we spent a lot of time working on that, and not just working that out, which involved experimentation, not the kind of experimentation you're used to doing, like, you know, okay, we're going to draw blood, what's the minimum volume, let's take it all the through, like on practice samples, we had volunteers who gave us practice specimens. You know, exactly as we would be handling it, short of, like, having it in space itself. And then run it all the way through the analyses, look at different methods, compare what the validity of the experiments are and their consistency. You know, it's a lot of sort of pedestrian but detailed work that you do, like, sort of from an engineering point of view that would just never be part of a normal biology or medical experiment, but we have to do it in this context. But then, in real time, because we already had such a great working relationship, we got along incredibly well, and I remember, I'll never forget, there was one of our conference calls, we would have these every week to two depending upon where in the program we were. And, the delivery spacecraft, thank goodness, it didn't have any astronauts on board, but it was an unmanned delivery spacecraft by one of the commercial carriers that blew up on the way. And, you know, that was really bad news, we're all really upset about this, it was in the news, you know, but we're thinking, oh my gosh, what's going to happen with the experiments. And sure enough, there were supplies, you can't just send them all up ahead of time, because of weight. So, there were supplies, and tubes and so forth, and I just remember all sitting around on the phone and you know, who needs this tube more than somebody else on this particular day? In this case, I didn't really need it as much as Emmanuel Mignot needed it because he needed a tube for the second part of his immune vaccine response thing. And it, if we had our tube he couldn't do that. And I said, you know, this one's for you, we will get by without that time point. He would have done exactly the same thing if the tables were turned. But that's what I mean, I mean NASA thinks like this, we all got to participate in this wonderful cooperative venture, and it's all, a lot of this is just opaque to the astronauts. I mean, they have to focus on what they have to do. But these dedicated people on the ground, the mission's operations people, the people in the HRP, you know, the administrative people, all the logistical people, I mean they knocked themselves out. I know the astronauts get the fame, they deserve it, we're glad of it, but I hope that people who are listening realize like how much hard work is done behind the scenes by NASA people who makes all this possible. So, I just wanted to communicate that. It really is a different kind of experience working with NASA.  Host: Yeah, and Steve, to Andy's point, I mean, this is, not only is the research itself very expansive, and you said this was coming from after the One-Year Mission, you know, let's get together and think about what we could do with this Twins Study, but it is this giant collaborative effort. So, where did you start? You got this idea, okay, there are these two twins we can work with, Scott Kelly and Mark Kelly, and we can go into a little bit about who they are, just to add a little bit more context, but where do you start saying, you know, who do we reach out to? Who would be interested in this type of science?  Dr. Steve Platts: Well, we did rapid solicitation. And, Andy said they saw this solicitation and said hey, that's something that we're interested in. And, that's how the whole team was formed. And we had, you know, a lot of people had contacts and said hey, make sure you see this, because this is the kind of thing you'd be interested in. And so, usually it takes a year and a half plus from when we solicit for a grant proposal to when we could actually start the work. And I think that we did this in under nine months.  Host: Wow.  Dr. Steve Platts: And had everything going. We had the investigators working group that Andy was talking about when we brought everyone in, and we thought we were going to have to have this long conversation about authorship and everything and everyone was like yeah, whatever, okay what do we need to do? And one of the other things that, when Andy was talking, I was thinking of is, and you don't think about this when you do science on the ground, but when you do science in space, you really have to think about it. We didn't have a tube on the space station that could do what we needed to be done. And so we had to flight certify a whole new tube. So, Andy was saying that they had to do some like, pre-research on the ground before, they had to figure out if this tube was going to work. Right? And if it would work for all the parties involved. So, just those kind of things that you don't think about when you're doing research on the space station, that's 220-ish plus miles above the earth, traveling at 17,500 miles an hour, with limited power, limited mass, all of these things you have to consider that a lot of scientists here on earth don't have to deal with, and all of these folks not only dealt with it, but made it a huge success.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Yeah, let me say something.  Dr. Steve Platts: Sure.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Let me jump in. My, you know, about the tubes, because it's a really great story and I think people will enjoy it. So, you know one of the nice things about this thing is I actually got to do some of this stuff back in the lab. So I'm like in there myself, because we're talking about like, sort of, you know, fashion science, that actually got so fancy that I understand it, but I don't normally, you know, do the manipulations of the genomic libraries, we have specialists for that. But here, we're talking about like tubes and spinning blood through it, and like matching the gravitational conditions that, you know, the centrifuges that they have, which is some old, half-broken thing by the way. It's been up there for like ten years.  Dr. Steve Platts: We have a new one, though. We have a new one. [ Laughter ] Not in time for your study, but yeah. We have it.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: So you know, so we're working this out, but then there's this critical issue that come up right away, and it has to do with when you're doing epigenetics research, I do have to get a little ahead and talk about what that is for a minute. So, epigenetics, this is why the twins are really interesting, so epigenetics has to do with information that's in the cell that's remembered when the cell divides other than the DNA sequence itself. So, what's that mean? That means things like DNA methylation which is a chemical change in one of those four nucleotides, the, it's the cytosine, you know like Gattaca, the c in Gattaca, that's cytosine, and it is something that turns genes on and off. That's one of the things, but that's the one that we focused on. And what that's responsible for is it tells you what your cells do, so like, as the DNA sequences like the words like in the alphabet, the epigenetic information is the grammar. And that's the reason why your stomach is different than your eyeball. I mean, they have the same DNA sequence in them, but they're obviously really very different, and that has to do with specialized functions. It also is something that's effected by the environment, which is the question of the day, you're going into space flight, so, you know, that's going to be a different environment. So, if you have identical twins, you know, sure, there were people that were looking for genetic damage, but generally the genome will be the same, in fact that's what it was. So, what the differences might be that would have information content and tell cells to have a different function, would be epigenetic information, and you, the ideal way to do that is to have an identical twin on the ground, and another one in space.  But, here's the problem. Just, I just said that each of those different cell types has a different epigenetic pattern, or different methylation pattern. If you just draw blood from somebody, you have a whole mixture of cell types, and even if you can separate out the, what are called the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which include, like the b-cells, you've heard off, t-cells, monocytes, things like that. There's so many cell types that are among those. That, the tube is something that has a built-in membrane, so it could separate out those if he just drew the blood and then took that tube, just as it is, put it in a centrifuge, spun it round. You'd get those peripheral blood mononuclear cells. But we had to test to see whether or not we could actually fractionate out the subtypes of cells, and you have to do this if you're going to look at epigenetic information. So, we were looking at, like, what are called CD4 cells, CD8 cells, CD19 cells, things like that. These are like differences between, you know, the sort of different kinds of t-cells and b-cells, and so forth. So, they're very different in their normal methylation pattern. And we had to compare that to what if you just took fresh samples and looked at them? And the answer is, you lose that information. You cannot freeze these cells and then separate out the individual cell types later. So, the validity of these experiments would have been lost, at least for what we do. I mean, not for other things, there were other kinds of analyses people could do. But, for looking at DNA methylation for the high-resolution that we wanted to do, would not be possible. So, what we suggested, and I remember, we had a conversation, Kate Rubins was one of the astronauts in the room. So, I remember standing there; there was Kate, and me, and one of the other investigators, I can't remember if it was Mike Snyder or Chris Mason, and then Clarence Sams, who's this brilliant engineer who's in charge of deciding like what blood can get drawn, and what the operational conditionals are going to be. So, I mean, he sees the big picture. So, he's a scientist, he's a senior scientist at NASA. So, I remember our talk about this, I said, well, you know, Dr. Sams, I mean I think what we have to do is we have to let the astronauts pipette out the material in a glove box after it's been spun through the tube, and then they can combine it with this like antibody, we've done this a million times, they'll be able to separate that out, and if they can't do that, then at least what we would like them to do is take out those cells, wash them once, and then combine them with some glycerol, which is an okay way to preserve cells, it's not the ideal way, there's another chemical that you can't put on the space station, but they use glycerol, so it's should be fine. And then, they could freeze it, and then we could look at it later. And he said, you've got to be kidding. You know, like, this whole study has been, like, bootstrapped onto something, you know, we've planned these things like three-years ahead. This whole things been added on, we can't, like, put a whole procedure through certification, so that's completely out of the question. So, we said, well then you know, if we want to get this work done, then we're going to have to get Ambien samples, which means that the blood for our studies would have to be drawn on the day that a Soyuz is coming to earth, and that's what would happen.  So, there would be blood drawn, Scott would draw it himself, centrifuge it in that device, package it the way that we did, we had like these tubes, like pre-wrapped with some plastic in case they fractured, no glass would come loose, but also, we wouldn't lose the blood either. And then they would be loaded in the appropriate container, and sent by rocket ship to Kazakhstan, [laughs] and then a Leer jet would fly this and, I guess an astronaut, too, because they need to go home. I think it was always an astronaut going down and always an astronaut going up. And then they would be driven by Jeep, they had a Jeep ride, and then they converted one of the labs, the one that was used to store the lunar rocks, and they converted that, a part of that building into a lab for us and equipped with the facilities we needed. And we would have pre-positioned one of the scientists from our group, at one point, the scientist who was down there processing that was my son Jason, who's a scientist and he works with a collaborator mine, and he has special expertise in this purification. So, he was the right guy to do it, he's on the paper, too. And so, they would purify this stuff through the night, freeze it in the proper way, and then we'd show that would could isolate those materials in the way that we want.  Anyway, so getting back to this, I just kept nudging NASA about, you know, we want to show that it's not such a big deal to do this pipetting in space. They thought, well, you know, the materials going to get loose, the blood's going to float free, maybe it will hit the start button, and they'll be off to Mars prematurely or something. Who knows, right? But, I understand their point of view, but from my point of view it just seemed like it's not that difficult. But, you know, this is, we have to follow those rules. So, I kept bugging them and then I get a call one day and they say, hey, guess what, if you can do this right away, we're going to rush through a review process for your doing this veryt testing on the Vomit Comet. So, that's that aircraft, transport plane that they modified for parabolic flight. So, my post-doc Lindsay Rizzardi and I spent a week doing parabolic flights, so we would be, we'd have these evolutions of weightlessness, and that's when we would do our experiments. So, we'd be pulling 2 point something g's, and then we'd be at total zero g's, and then we would be handling the material in the glove box. What was really fantastic is that Kate Rubins was there on the first day, independently. She decided this is really an idea worth pursuing, and she threw her [inaudible] on it. She's the astronaut obviously, worked out and with another scientist, Brian Crucian, and so we wound up all just collaborating together. Brian was on this thing, too. So, Kate, and Lindsay, and Brian and I, and Clarence, too. We wound up showing how this is done, it actually turns out to be very easy. It's easier if you have the right tips to pipette liquids in zero gravity than it is on earth, because of the surface tension. We noticed it's difficult to keep the pipette tips in place, they tend to float away, so they'll have to come up with another box to store them, it was sort of amusing how they sort of came released in the glove box. I think NASA was right to be worried, but not because of the blood, because of the tips. But we showed how it could be done, and we even did some of the first sequencing using a little, these mini-sequencers now, that was done in the Vomit Comet. And then we continued to collaborate with Kate during her mission, on her free time she continued to do sequencing and operations with DNA, using materials that are approved by NASA for sort of ordinary use, so instead of bringing like a private kit up of supplied from her husband, Jeff, would send up to her, like pipettes and tips and things like that. And so, you know, we still maintain that interaction, because we think in the long-run the astronauts are really going to be doing this, and then at the right point, NASA will go through the certification process for this kind of work. So, it turned out to be, it's like you know, it's like with NASA, you know you have to follow the procedure, but, you know, if you could figure out how to do something, they'll work with you to get it done.  Host: Yeah. And what's interesting about this, is this for the, you know, the epigenetics part of things, you had to have these special tools, these special techniques, and this is just one element of what, Steve, you were saying was these ten different elements of these four categories. I mean, this is just a lot of, a lot of material, a lot of information going into this Twins Study, and this is just one part of it that needs to be collaborated as part of this larger idea. If you can, actually, Steve, go over some of the other parts. You know, this was just, these tubes story was for the epigenetics part and, there's certain things that are required just to get that science, what about the other science, what else are we looking at?  Dr. Steve Platts: Well, we had folks looking at biochemistry, right? So, just the normal, everyday bio markers and things in your blood, saliva, urine, that we study all the time, already. But, again, in a One-Year Mission, and then, again, when you have twins, that adds a whole, another layer to it. We had a group looking at more physiology type stuff, and so they were, they did a lot of cardiovascular physiology, looking at oxidative stress and those kind of things. And different proteins. We had a group looking at the micro-biome. So, this is, actually, a lot of the listeners might be familiar, it's in the press all the time now, micro-biome. I even saw it on TV, there was an advertisement for some soap product, and they were talking about it's so gentle it doesn't disturb your micro-biome. [Laughs]. Okay, but what is micro-biome, right? So, imagine everything that's most of the cells in your body are not your cells, right? They are bacteria, they're fungi, they're other things. They're inside you, they're outside you, they're all over you. And they contribute to your health and well-being. They're actually part of you. And so, how does that change when you go into space? You can imagine you have six people in a tiny, little, confined environment and how eating the same foods, you know, being in close proximity, doing all those kind of things, might shift how your gut is behaving, and how the things on your skin are. So, we had a whole study looking at things like that. Immunology, he mentioned Brian Crucian, who's one of our immunologists at JSC. And so, he did a whole study on immunology and we had an investigator who looked at the flu vaccine. And, so, does your immune system work the same in space? So, if I got a vaccine in space, is it going to work the same way? Turns out, yeah, it does, it works just the same way. So, very exciting there. And, cognition. So, we had a group looking at how your brain works, right? So, how, we hear all the time when we talk to astronauts that they get the space fuzzies, right? They kind of get this fuzziness, blurriness doing things in space, and what is that form? Is that from the fluid shift? Is that, you know, from, they often don't eat enough calories and so they tend to lose weight. Is that part of it? And so we had a study up there for this mission also, looking at the cognitive ability, so not just can you remember things, but the speed and the accuracy and those kind of things. So, if you're thinking about, so now we're looking at genetics, genomics, epigenetics, micro-biome, biochemistry, immunology, physiology. I mean, we have everything, right? And so, really, this is the first time we have had an integrated study like this where we can look at the whole gamut. We can look at what's going on with DNA, we can look at what's going on with RNA. We can look what's going on with the whole organ, the whole body, the mind, all of that connected. So, it's, I mean, just you know, very exciting.  Host: Now, along the points of executing this science, you know, Andy was talking about these specific tubes, and these specific techniques that need to be practiced to make sure that the science was good for his particular part, which was epigenetics. And I'm sure that every scientist has their needs.  Dr. Steve Platts: Oh, yes.  Host: You know, they have their, what do they want to study? They have particular tubes or whatever they may have, that is necessary for their science. How do you fit that into a year? How do you allot that into a crewmember's time making sure that all of this can be addressed and executed over the course of a year?  Dr. Steve Platts: Very carefully. [Laughter]. So, we actually have an element within HRP called ISSMP, it's the ISS Medical Project, and that's what they do. They work on the experiments, and they're the folks who are talking to Andy about tubes and processes, how do you do this? And they coordinated each individual experiment into a larger experiment. They work with the schedulers for the astronauts. They work with the ISS program, so this team, that's what they're designed for, that's what they do every day for every experiment we ever do. So, for them, this wasn't all that unusual, it was a lot in one big lump, but it was sort of business as usual. Okay, so we have this experiment, they want to draw out 20 mils of blood. How do we do that? Okay, we know they want them on these days, okay. Can we do those days? Oh, we can't do this day, because there's an EVA on that day, or a space-walk. So, then they figure out how to move it. So, all of those intricacies, and we call it project implementation, right? And so that's what these folks do, and they do a tremendous job. And so they were put on the spot to do this and all the other One-Year Mission stuff. And then, the other crew members we had on board doing the regular science.  Host: Right.  Dr. Steve Platts: Right? All of that was going on all at the same time. We had a few people who didn't sleep very much for a while, you know. They were working really hard, but I think it's a testament to the whole group as Andy said, that it went off as well as it did.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Yeah, and just a minor thing, but they have to figure out the weight of everything we use.   Dr. Steve Platts: Mm-hmm  Dr. Andy Feinberg: And also the power drain, you know, for every procedure and how that matches up with other things they're doing. So, because you know, it's a finite thing and it has to keep everybody, you know, healthy, and have all their other mission critical things running. So, it's incredibly complicated.  Host: And this is sort of adding to your point, Steve, that this is not just a one-year thing, there's a lot of planning that goes beforehand, there's a lot of research that goes beforehand, and you even said, even after the One-Year Mission was done, you know, you were still doing research. There was still a data gathering period.  Dr. Steve Platts: Absolutely, yes. So, when, so if things change, when do they come back? If they come back to normal. That's critical for us.  Host: Right.  Dr. Steve Platts: Because our astronauts have to live when they come home. And so we want to know if something changes, how long does it take to come back to normal? So, that's part of the process. We have different time points after flight so that we can follow up and make sure that the crew are healthy.  Host: Yeah, so, Andy, you could probably go into a little bit more detail here, but just especially from an epigenetic standpoint, just exactly what is the most interesting part about having, and you could probably address this more, identical twins, you know, in space and on the ground. What exactly is interesting about that, and what was the execution on your end to look at this?  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Okay, well, so first the headline news from the analysis of their epigenetic information is that there was nothing that changed in Scott over the course of a year that was out of the range of the variation that we see in Mark. So, in other words, in terms of like, is space causing some overall change to their epigenetic information that we measure, of course we're just measuring methylation, but is there anything about that that's out of kilter, sort of on a large-scale way with what you'd see in Mark, and the answer to that is no. But, I was surprised to find that there was a fairly striking degree of variation over the course of a year, both of them. So, people have followed things like gene expression, like the activity of genes over long periods of time in these, you know, these studies where they kind of sample you at regular intervals. Mike Snyder's done that kind of work, actually on himself, over the course of a year. But, well, I don't, to my knowledge, nobody's done this at the level of DNA methylation, at least with this kind of comprehensive analysis across the genome, purifying the individual cell types, and it really does vary by several percent. Nothing out of the normal range, but I was surprised by that. And, what we saw was that, overall, levels of DNA methylation across all the genes, I mean there's, you know, thousands and thousands of genes in the genome, there's an argument over the exact number, but it's at least 17,000 genes probably less than 25,000 depending upon what you call a gene. But there's, there's a several percent change in DNA methylation in a couple of the different cell types that we looked at. Not necessarily in the same direction, either. And, but Mark showed similar changes in overall levels of DNA methylation across his genome. So, it was specific to Scott. And I think this gets to another point that Scott raised when he was, on one of the podcasts, when he was being interviewed initially about this whole idea, is that the n, what we call the n, the number of, the real number sort of experimental replicates, is one, we have one twin pair. So, just Scott and Mark. When I wrote our proposal, I suggested that we also get samples from additional astronauts who were in space. That would enable us to determine whether anything that we saw in Scott was, if it was different than Mark is that something that is reproduced in other astronauts. So, we want to increase that n to like two, or three, or four, or whatever. NASA said we couldn't do it because remember what Steve said at the beginning; this was an add-on special project. So, there wasn't the capacity to then go expand that to other astronauts and the whole consent process, and so forth. That all had to get worked out. It's very complicated, how to deal with what could be, like, you know, personal medical information and all of that, right? So, they couldn't do that. So, you cannot say that what we observe is caused, at a global level, is caused by space flight. It could just be random chance, just on the face of it, looking at the total levels of methylation. It could be some other aspect of the environment. Maybe not microgravity, it could be the food that they eat, right? They were eating this like package stuff that, you know, in the 1960s and 1970s, you know, looked really cool. You know, Tang through a straw and like some kind of like, you know, apparently, it's tasty, they didn't let me taste any, but you know, sort of mushed up stuff in a plastic freeze-dried bag. I mean, you know, it's different. And one other big difference between Mark and Scott is that Mark can have alcohol when he's on the ground, and it's absolutely forbidden on the space station. Because even the most miniscule vapors that come from alcohol are bad for some of the equipment that they use in environmental control. And I don't think that's fully understood why that is, but it is certainly an absolute proscription. So, there are some, and that's a pretty significant potential epigenetic modifier, too. So, you know, they're well within their range. Now, that said though, we did a different kind of analysis, a serial analysis, where we're looking at serial -- like S-E-R-I-A-L, I was just talking about food, it's not the other kind.  Dr. Steve Platts: Oh, I thought you were talking about Captain Crunch.  Host: Yeah, I was getting hungry. [Laughter].  Dr. Andy Feinberg: No, but it's a sequential, you know, analysis. So, we then also asked, well what is consistent in terms of DNA methylation before he goes into space, then changes as he goes into space, and then when he comes back to normal, returns to the baseline, are there things like that? And we did find differences in Scott. And then you can ask, well, are they, did these genes fall into certain categories? And indeed, they did. They fell into gene categories that are related to either inflammation, or stress. And, those two things are highly, what we call convoluted in science. In other words I mean, things that are related, inflammation, are also related to stress and vice versa. So, there was something that looked like that, and we didn't see those changes in Mark over that time course.  Now, because, still it's an n of one, we can't say that this related to space flight. That's just not, you know, not until it's verified. But it's awfully tantalizing. And the other thing that was consistent with that is that the people who were looking at gene expression, they say changes in gene expression that fell into those same categories, too. So, there does seem to be something related to an increased stress response in space that, after he comes back to earth over, you know, by several months later, that that goes back to baseline. And if I said normal before, I used the wrong word, I really should say baseline. And the reason is that even these changes are within the range of what we would say for people who are on earth that were exposed to stressful situations, like, for example an infection. Like, getting the flu, or getting some other infection. You'll get changes like this. And I don't know about methylation, but it's certainly in gene expression. You'll see changes like this, too. So, it's not like it's some space special thing, but it appears, again, with the n of one caveat, it appears that there really is something going on in terms of stress response in space, and what they need to do now, I would hope it would be we, that I'd love to participate in this, but we'll see, but what has to be done next is to repeat these observations on additional astronauts. And then I want to touch on something that you actually mentioned, I think at the beginning in your introduction, that's as we're thinking about going to Mars, and we're going to be trying to understand what happens when you go out for you know three years in space, is it possible for us to project from what the experience is in in a three month space flight, in a six month space flight, in a one year space flight, if we can project how to tell about time dependent trends that occur. Than we then make a projection into what's going to happen when you're three years out. Because if you can do that, you might be able to identify, it's a kind of like personalized preventative medicine, or just medical care for astronauts who are going to go as a group, or maybe even individually. We're going to go on really long-term missions, including for example, like have the right supplies for things that happen when they're, you know, when they're traveling into space.  And I think the most exciting thing that coming to your real answer now, the most exciting aspect, I think, of our study, is that it was the dawn of the genomic era of space. So, we really did work out the methods, both in terms of the mechanics of how you do these experiments, how you do this kind of analysis on very small amounts of material, how you can coordinate with different kinds of investigators, and also how you analyze the data. I mean, we did some real work in trying to figure out like, longitudinally, how do you analyze people's data, serially over time, and compare that to pre-flight and post-flight, a lot of the methods that we worked out could be used to extrapolate to longer distance space flights, and I think that will help to answer that question as they go out, you know, for longer duration missions. And while we didn't do any sequencing on this flight, some of the preparative stuff did lead to some sequencing, and Kate's already done that. Not, as an official, you know, actually, I think there are some sequencing projects that were part of the last mission, but that's getting incorporated, too.  So I think that as people go to Mars, they're going to need to be, fairly autonomous of NASA. I mean, for one thing, you know, as you could see from the movie The Martian, which I think has a lot of the details right, you can have a conversation where the response might take 20 minutes to get back. And, certainly not going to be able to ship extra materials to people and so forth. So, they're going to have to be autonomous in a lot of ways. One of them is they're going to be, they're going to need to be autonomous in terms of evaluating their health status. And part of doing that is measuring the genome, the epigenome gene expression. And also, just bacterial things. So, you know, you can, it's probably not going to be a great idea to have an incubator full of pathogens that are in the space craft because you need positive controls for doing assays for drug resistance. I don't think you're really going to want to have dangerous organisms there that you can compare. Somebody gets an infection, the response to that infection, you know, and to this drug or that drug, but the positive control, you know, of the actual bad thing; might be a lot better idea to take your little specimen and sequence it and know exactly what's in there. And you already have on hand the medicines you can use. But it isn't just that, I mean there are other disorders that might be difficult to diagnose where ancillary methods, if you take the whole ten studies as an aggregate would be very helpful. So, working that out, and then figuring out how to project what's going to happen to astronauts on long-term space flight I think would be really helpful, and I think that this study was the study that opened the door to that.  Host: Yeah. There's definitely a lot to this study. And to your point, man, would it be nice to increase that n to like, a thousand, I don't know. You guys probably know this more than me, being scientists, but man, it would be nice to get more of those studies, but this is an opportunity in and of itself. To explore that more would be absolutely fantastic. But, Steve, you know, Andy was going into some of the things that, especially in the epigenetics world, what are we finding from this study? We're starting to get some of these data back, and understand what was happening even with this n of one, you understand a little bit what was happening in all these different areas, so what else, besides epigenetics, what else is happening in the Twins Study world?  Dr. Steve Platts: Well, just to pick up on one thing that Andy said.  Host: Sure.  Dr. Steve Platts: And one of the things that I think is beautiful about this study is he said that the markers that he was looking at were showing stress and inflammation. And if you look at all the biochemistry, and physiology, and pharmacology we've been doing for years, the main things that we see are inflammation, and the same types of things, the stress, that Andy's talking about. And we have multiple studies looking at those exact things. So, even though it's new, it's reinforcing things that we already know, right? So, I mean that's one of the beautiful things about how they link up. As far as some of the other things they did, so, one of the groups looked at cardiovascular responses. And so they looked at the carotid artery in the neck. And it's known that if you measure the thickness of the wall of that blood vessel, that relates to overall cardiovascular health. And it's used here on earth, we actually use it at NASA as a technique to look at the astronauts and see how things are going. And they showed that in space for the twins, Scott has an increased thickening in that carotid artery. And so, oh, that's interesting, right? What does that mean? And now when they only got to do a four-day return, right, so they didn't get to do long-term to see how long it took to recover. On earth, we know what that means, in space we have no idea what that means, right? Something that happens that mimics a pathology, but then either comes back to normal or something that in space, our mind automatically goes to, well it must be the same, right? It must be a pathology, right? But that's not necessarily true. So, we don't really know. We know that changes, we know that vessel will get thicker, and in other investigators, not in the Twins Study, but in other space flight studies have shown that those same vessels also get stiffer. Ah, now stiffness, that can relate to blood pressure control, and we know that astronauts have issues with blood pressure control when they come back from space, especially long duration. So it's starting to help us kind of link more and more of these chains together to figure out the big picture of what's going on. I mentioned earlier the immunology, where they gave the flu vaccine, and they showed that the vaccine makes the body respond in exactly the same way in space as it does on the ground, which is very, very interesting as well. And so, you know, just a lot of different things. Cognition, that study was kind of mixed. They showed that there weren't changes in a lot of it, but there was one assay where they showed a decrease in accuracy of some of the responses. And again, what the long term follow up is, we're still working on those kind of things. So, just lots of really interesting things. Andy, I wonder if you'd be able to say just a few words about the telomeres, because I think that's really exciting, but I'm not technically proficient in describing that. So I wonder if you could describe that?  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Yeah, sure. So, that wasn't our, you know, our part of the study, but they found an increase in telomere length for Scott during space flight compared to Mark. And it was observed over, I think, all eleven in-flight time points in which they measured it. And they did this in number of different ways. Their data are really solid. And then that also came back, I'm pretty sure, it came back to either the same level it was before or close to it, after space flight. And so, I mean that's an interesting observation, because telomeres are the ends of chromosomes, and the length has been associated with, you know, disease states and with aging, and so forth. So, again, this is an n of one, you have to always keep in mind that, you know, you have to look at what you would see in other individuals. You have to repeat it. But it shows that it's something worth looking at, just like the stress factors are.  Host: So, you understand--  Dr. Andy Feinberg: By the way, I want to just mention, we did see methylation changes, and there were also gene expression changes consistent with this observation. So that was another reason why this multi-modality study is useful, because at least you know the technical observations are really probably right. It's probably not a measurement error, or a method error, if you're seeing by completely different kinds of measurements data that are consistent with one another. So, I think there's no question that his telomeres changed length. The question is whether or not another astronaut you would see that, or to what degree you would see that, and then what you could relate that too specifically in the environment. And none of these things can be answered, but certainly raises a good question.  Host: So, is the idea, you understand what happened in this particular case, but how does this apply to the grander, you know, space flight. What does that mean when an astronaut is going to land on a different planet? Like, those are the sorts of things that you could take this data and apply it to future space flight and help you understand what you need to do.  Dr. Steve Platts: Yeah, I think Andy hit the nail on the head earlier when he said this is really telling us how to do it.  Host: Right.  Dr. Steve Platts: Right? I call it a pathfinder mission, because really this is the first time we ever tried to do, you know, real genetics in space. And, this study taught us how to do it. And for the future, I mean, it just opened up everything for the future. Now, we have astronauts who were never ever interested in doing anything genetic, you can imagine how some folks might be trepidations about doing genetic studies, right? Having their genome potentially out there, the loss of privacy, that could mean, although we're extremely careful about that. But now we have astronauts coming up to us, asking us about genetic studies and what are we doing next, and how can we do this? So, this study, just beyond the scientific advances it's going to help us make, the technological and the philosophical advances it's going to help NASA make, we can't even figure out what those are just yet. I think they're going to be tremendous.  Host: Yeah.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Yeah, if I could add a little to that, sort of bring it home. So, the really big issues that are going to face them that we haven't addressed in terms of like genomic integrity are, well what happens if there's an exposure on the space craft to something? And, so we don't know what, right? So, there could be like a solar flare, there could be some environmental contaminant on the space craft, whatever. There needs to be a mechanism to sort of robustly, and without having to do 2-3 years of planning, have a mechanism for them to be able to assess that. I mean, what I'm talking about when they travel to Mars. So, you know, there can be some evaluation of the effects of things without knowing in advance what they might be. So, I think you need to have some kind of laboratory capability, simple laboratory capability. And nowadays you can have things that are so modular and so small that I don't think it's asking a lot to do that. These guys are incredibly dedicated, they learn really well, they actually physically have great dexterity, and they're very curious, and they're like you know, either engineers already, or they have an engineering mind. And I say guys and women, I mean, actually it's one of the really interesting things of the study by the way is that, you know, there are these changes in the shape of the eye, and there're changes in the retina that are associated with visual problems. But the women don't get this, right? So, they're like, it's just not going to happen in the women. So, I think it's very important to include men and women in these analyses in a robust way, too. But the really big thing that's different about what happens when they go to Mars is the radiation. It's much greater. I mean, the amount of radiation that Scott got exposed to was sort of like four PET scans, something like that, over the course of a year. Not out of line, like within an order of magnitude of what airline pilots get. Why? Because they're inside the Van Allen Belt. I mean, they're in low-earth orbit. It's more radiation than we get down here, but not that much more. But, when they go to Mars, they're not going to have that shielding, and there's this, not only more radiation, but this high energy radiation, a cosmic radiation, which are these, you know, heavy metal nuclei that are very damaging when they hit. I mean, they have to hit the DNA. And we don't know anything about that, because people haven't been there. Steve probably knows this, what the actual number is, but we haven't had very many human beings outside of the Earth's protective field. Just the people who went to the moon. Either circled it or landed there. So, I don't know what is, a couple of weeks or something like that is the longest exposure.   Host: Yeah very short.  Dr. Steve Platts: Yeah.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Yeah. So, that's a big question. So, if they're going to be sending people out, like to the moon, you know, for, you know, to the lunar orbit or--   Dr. Steve Platts: Yeah, the Gateway that we're building.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: Or some period of time. That's when you can answer that question. And so, you know, I don't know if NASA's decided what they're going to do, but I think there's a really good, there's a really important part for doing these kinds of measures, doing this all over again really when astronauts are going to be either on the Moon or at one of the, I think they're called the La Grange points, where they have a sort of a stable orbit, for some period of time, actually. And then you can collect a symmetry, you can understand what kinds of radiation exposure there were, and you can ask these questions. I think we're going to get different answers then, because I think the radiation's going to be more substantial, and I think that's their biggest threat. And I was on a panel with the National Academy of Sciences that also identified for the HRP, you know, this is one of the things that is a particularly high priority issue for which we don't really have that kind of information.  Dr. Steve Platts: And we are working on exactly those things right now with the Gateway program that's spinning up, and we are going to put a station orbiting the moon. And the first thing we told them we have on board is bio-dissymmetry. So, we're absolutely right with you that, we're thinking about that radiation and we have an element that all they study is space radiation and so, we're looking at that intensely.  Host: It's very fitting all the research that's going into this Twins Study, you can take a lot of it and expand that knowledge.  Dr. Steve Platts: Absolutely.  Host: You can just keep learning, keep more and more in science. Always great.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: And by the way, I got stumbled up there on my words, but just for your listeners out there, Mars is something like 50 to 400 million kilometers, something like that I think, from Earth depending upon when you're looking. Something like that, right?  Host: Yeah.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: But the Moon, the Moon is only something like a couple hundred thousand miles away, and so, you know, getting back and forth is not that difficult, especially if you don't actually land. So, I think, this issue about genomic integrity, it's one of the major reasons I think to gather more data that's closer to earth. If something does happen to somebody, you can send them back, they need something, you can send it out there. It's not that impossible to do.  Host: Yeah, there's still, there's definitely a lot more science that we need to do to really understand how to go further and further. And Andy, too, to your point, you know, Mars is just a couple more steps beyond the Moon. So, it's going to be, it's going to be a challenge just to get there. You're talking about a few days of a mission there and back versus months. Even, I guess years, expanding past a year to get there and back. At the very least. But guys, I know we're past our hour here, and I have so many more questions, but I know that with the recent release of some of these findings you can go, I'll talk about a website at the very end of the podcast here where people can go and check out some of the other great findings that we have as part of this Twins Study. But I really just wanted to take this time to thank you both for taking the time to come and talk with us on the podcast and get this great information out. This is just, I think really a taste of all there is to the Twins Study. And it sounds like there's a lot more science that we need to do to fully understand all of these different elements. So, really guys, I appreciate your time, thank you.  Dr. Steve Platts: Oh, you're very welcome.  Dr. Andy Feinberg: It was wonderful talking to you, thanks so much. Appreciate it.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. So, today we got a chance to talk to Dr. Andy Feinberg and Dr. Steve Platts, going into the intricate details of all these elements of the Twins Study. Now, we really only got to address a little bit of it. Again, this is a very dense study, lots of different investigations. And we just recently published some of the findings. So if you go to NASA.gov/twins-study -- that's Twins dash Study -- you can list, first of all, what is the Twins Study, but then you can actually see some of the recently published findings and really go into the intricate details of what some of the research that was done over these past few years.  Otherwise, in terms of the human research program, we have worked with them before. You can go to NASA.gov/hrp to look at some of the human research. Otherwise, we've done a five-series, or a five hazards of human space flight series with the Human Research Program. We got to talk to even one of the investigators that were part of the Twins Study here, Dr. Crucian, Dr. Brian Crucian. We got to talk to him about immunology, you can listen to one of those episodes there. Of course, all of this research is being done aboard the International Space Station, NASA.gov/iss to find out what's happening there. And Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, all of the different accounts that we have, the Johnson Space Center accounts, and of course, the International Space Station to figure out what's going on. So, this episode was recorded on April 1st, 2019. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Norah Moran, Pat Ryan, and Shaniqua Vereen. Thanks again to our Twins Study experts, Dr. Andy Feinberg, and Dr. Steve Platts for coming on the show. So, if you are sticking with us right now, thank you for listening to this entire episode, and you're in for a very special treat. Because next week we kick off a four-part series on a very unique story. So, with me is Pat Ryan, producer of the podcast to tell us more. Thanks for joining me, Pat.  Pat Ryan: Hey kids.  Host: [Laughs]. So, what exactly Pat are we in for for this four-part series? What's it all about?  Pat Ryan: Last year I discovered that there had been a project going on in another part of the production facility, that I wasn't involved in at all. But one of my colleagues here told the story and it struck me as almost like a mystery story. The more he kept telling I'd go, what? We did what? How did we do that? And I said that needs to be a podcast. So, Greg Wiseman and I resolved to try to produce this story for the podcast, and we did it by doing podcast interviews with a lot of the people who were involved, but then cutting them together so that the story is told from all of their different perspectives, their different points of view, and we mixed in music and sound effects, and we also mixed in Mission Control room conversations from Apollo 11, the first landing on the Moon. That's what the whole thing is about, rescuing the sounds of the people who worked here at the Manned Space Craft Center in Houston in 1969 to make sure that Apollo 11 went off successfully.  Host: And this is a little bit different from our normal podcast. Obviously, if you've been listening to us, it's, really, we just sit down with a guest and talk face to face for, and go really into a topic, but this is a little different in the way we structured this podcast.  Pat Ryan: The story could have been told by talking to any one of several people, and that would have been fine, but I thought that there were enough different people involved in it, from different angles, that it would be worth talking to them all. And we did and then what we put together is a condensed version of those interviews, with some narration to hold all the pieces together, to tell it over a broader sense. And to tell it in a little different way, mostly because we can.  Host: And I really hope you guys enjoy it. Next week we're going to kick it off. It's, the title is the Heroes Behind the Heroes, and there's a very great story as to why it's titled that. It kicks off next week, with part one, and there's again, four parts to this story, and we're going to go into the intricate details really of what it took to rescue these tapes. Pat, thank you for coming on, and talking about this. That will kick off actually a series of Apollo episodes we have as we near the 50th anniversary of the landing on the Moon. So, with that, check it out next week, the Heroes behind the Heroes. We'll see you then."

            "description": ">> Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the nasa johnson space center, episode 7: total eclipse over america. I m gary jordan and i ll be your host today. So this is the podcast where we bring in the experts-- nasa scientists, engineers, astronauts-- all to tell you the coolest stuff about nasa. So today we re talking about eclipses with mark matney. He s a space debris scientist here at the nasa johnson space center in houston texas, and he also has degrees in astronomy and space physics, and is an avid eclipse aficionado. We had a great discussion about what an eclipse is, some of the history of eclipses, and some of the science that we ve learned and continue to learn from them. This is an exciting conversation, especially because on august 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse will sweep across america. Mark and i talked about where the eclipse will pass through and how you ll be able to see it. They don t happen very often-- the last time a total solar eclipse happened over the states was back in 1991, and we won t see another until 2024. Anyway, we ll get into all that good stuff during this episode. So with no further delay, let s go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with dr. Mark matney. Enjoy. [ Music ] >> t minus five seconds and counting. Mark. [ Indistinct radio chatter ] >> houston, we have a podcast. [ Music ] >> all right, well, mark, thank you for coming on the podcast today. Perfect timing, because very soon we re going to have a total solar eclipse that s going to pass over the united states. And so i think this is a good chance for us to sit down and talk about eclipses. And you went above and beyond for this one, mark, because you have a lot of different things. I mean, we re talking a lot of science, we re talking a long and detailed history of eclipses. You know, this is not just a, ooh, look at that. Pretty eclipse. No, nasa s going all out for this-- is that fair to say? >> Well, i think this is-- i mean, eclipses have been part of human history as far back as we can record. People have been fascinated, scared, terrified by eclipses. >> Oh, sure. >> And a lot of important scientific discoveries have been driven by eclipses. I think today-- we re doing some science today, but much of the important science was done in the past. But this kind of links us in some sort of way to those early scientists who were trying to puzzle out the mysteries of the universe by using this amazing sight in the sky. So we have some science that s going on, we have some citizen science that s going on, and there s going to be a whole lot of people traveling to see this eclipse. In fact, i was reading that this eclipse is the first cross continent eclipse across the united states since the interstate system was built. >> Oh, wow. >> And so we might see one of the largest migrations of americans in a short period of time that we ve ever seen. [ Laughter ] because there s going to be a lot of people, perhaps tens of millions of people, traveling to see this eclipse. >> That s very true, and they re all going to be, i mean, closer to that nice, thin line-- we re talking about that path of totality, and we ll get into that really shortly, but you know, let s go and start at the very beginning, right? So we re talking about a total solar eclipse-- this is great-- passing over the united states. But what is that? What is a total solar eclipse? >> So a total eclipse is when the disk of the sun is completely covered by the moon. So the moon s size is maybe slightly larger than the sun, so we can get complete coverage. This particular eclipse is going to be about two and a half minutes of totality. Some eclipses are as high as seven minutes. Some of them are just a few seconds. >> And it s just the way things are aligning? >> Well, it turns out that the moon is actually not on a perfectly circular orbit. It s in a slightly elliptical orbit. So sometimes it s a little closer, and sometimes it s a little farther. >> Oh, i see. >> And so [ indistinct ] a little farther, it doesn t quite cover the surface of the sun. And what you end up with is a narrow ring all around. That s called an annular eclipse. And if the moon s a little larger-- in other words, a little closer, it appears a little larger in the sky, you get a total eclipse. And sometimes we actually have what s called a hybrid eclipse where you get an annular eclipse, but the mountains on the moon make it so it s actually a broken ring in the sky. It s so close, because actually, the mountains peeking up cover part of that sun ring. >> So can you see some of the sun peeking through those alleys, i guess? >> That s right, yes. >> Oh, interesting. >> And then that one, turns out if you could get higher in the altitude, in a balloon or plane, you might see a total eclipse in those kinds. But that s a special kind of eclipse that s actually quite rare. >> Wow. >> And then we also have a partial eclipse, and that s what-- it turns out this eclipse is interesting-- as far as i can tell, anyone in any of the 50 united states-- weather permitting-- should be able to see a partial eclipse, including alaska and hawaii. The partial eclipse is where the disk of the moon covers part of the sun but doesn t actually get to-- it s off to one side. >> Okay. >> And so you-- we re going to get a pretty good partial eclipse here from houston, but i think everybody, like i said, somewhere in the united states, one of the 50 states, should be able to see a partial eclipse. >> That ll be cool. >> So by the way, it s august 21st-- we didn t say the date. >> Yeah, so august 21st. And this will come out august 18th, so this ll be like-- >> oh, okay-- perfect. >> This ll be right next to it, yeah, absolutely. So a partial eclipse-- is there-- how-- is there a way that is very apparent to observe that? Like, will the sky get a little bit darker, or-- >> it depends on the percentage. When it s like about 50%, it s hard to notice. But once you get on to 60, 70, 80, 90%, the sky takes on an unusual color. And in fact, that s one of the things i m going to recommend eclipse observers-- just kind of note how the sky changes color, because it s a very interesting phenomenon. >> Yeah. >> But unless it s really-- in ancient times, people did not even notice a partial eclipse unless it was like 80, 90% because they started to see the sun dim, and they would look up at the sun and see there was no longer a disk in the sky. >> Wow. Okay, so from here in houston, what are we expecting percentage-wise? >> Well, i tried-- it s about somewhere around 70%. I don t know the exact area, but there s several tables. Also, that s another thing, is where you are, where the maximum eclipse changes on the clock. So there are computer resources where you can look and put in your location or your city and find out when the maximum eclipse is and how much. >> Oh, okay. Very cool. That s a lot of good stuff. All right, so that s 70%. We ll be able to see-- >> something like 70, yeah. >> A somewhat noticeable change in the sky, then, at least here from houston. That s really cool. So yeah, you said total versus partial. This is the solar eclipse, though, right? >> Right. >> This is when the moon is going in between the earth and the sun. >> Right. >> Like you said, they re relatively the same size in the sky, just based on distance and size, and so it only blocks off this tiny little strip of shadow that s going to go across the united states. And it goes-- you said it happens quite often, but just i guess at different parts of the world. >> Correct. >> It just so happens that it s going to line up this time going from coast to coast. >> And sometimes it s an annular, and sometimes-- but it turns out we get from three to five eclipses, solar eclipses, every year. >> Oh, okay. >> Which is actually kind of surprising. >> We meaning the earth. >> Someone on the earth, in other words, can see an eclipse. We actually have fewer-- there s another kind of eclipse called a lunar eclipse, and the lunar eclipse is when the earth gets between the moon and the sun. >> Right. >> And so as the moon moves into the shadow, it starts to turn dark, and sometimes has an interesting red color. >> Yeah. >> It turns out there are actually fewer of those than solar eclipses. >> Really? >> But because a whole hemisphere can see it, they re much-- you can see them much more often than solar eclipses. >> Oh, that-- okay. >> Because you re looking up in the sky and seeing the moon eclipse, so anybody on that side of the earth can see it-- weather permitting, of course. >> Wow. Why is it that color, though? >> Well, that s an interesting phenomenon. As you know, the sky is blue from the scattering of particles in the atmosphere-- it scatters the blue light. But the red is transmitted just like we see in a red sunset. Well, the earth s atmosphere actually refracts the red light, and so if you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, the earth, of course, would block the sun, but you would see this red ring around the earth, which is the atmosphere refracting the light of the sun. >> So that s the red ring of the earth refracting off the surface of the moon? >> No, no, it s-- the light is coming through the atmosphere and refracting slightly to your position on the moon. >> Oh. >> So you would see this narrow, narrow red glowing ring around the earth. >> Oh, wow. >> So it s-- but of course, no one s ever seen that. >> Yeah. >> Maybe someday when we have a base on the moon. >> Oh, and so wait-- okay, so this is assuming that-- yeah, you re assuming that you are an observer on the moon. >> You re an astronaut standing on the moon, right. >> I see, and there s a red ring. So what about the lunar eclipse-- the perception from the earth? Doesn t a lunar eclipse-- the moon looks a little orange? >> Yeah, it s orange-ish, sometimes. It actually depends on-- it depends on what s happening in the atmosphere. >> Oh, okay. >> For instance, i saw an eclipse in 1982. We were expecting the red moon, but in fact, the moon looked charcoal gray. And that was right after the el chichon volcano in mexico erupted. And so the dust from the volcano had changed the dust in the atmosphere, so we didn t get much red. >> Oh. >> So it actually-- you never know what you re going to see when you see a lunar eclipse, but they re often red. And again, that s the red light that is bent by the earth s atmosphere and shines on the moon. >> Yeah, and it s reflecting-- interesting. So it s all entirely about perception, then, it s about the-- so you re a person on the earth, and this is what you perceive from the perspective of earth. If you were outside floating millions of miles away just observing it from afar, it would just look like the earth and the moon-- the moon wouldn t look a certain color. >> Well, you could see the color, because it s lit up with that color. Let me-- let s change it around. Let s say you were on the moon looking at the earth during a solar eclipse. And we have some photographs from the iss of previous eclipses, and you actually see a-- you can actually see the dark shadow. You can t see the sharp edge of the shadow, but you see this fuzzy black thing on the surface of the earth. And so you would see-- but instead of being the whole earth swallowed up, you just see this black fuzzy spot moving across the earth from space. >> Interesting. >> So hopefully-- it depends on where the iss will be at the time of the eclipse, but hopefully they ll be able to photograph it from-- they probably will not be in the eclipse path, but they could look down on the earth and see the shadow, hopefully, of the eclipse. >> Yeah, i think-- i think they are predicting that the iss is going to be somewhere over canada but will have a nice view of the states whenever it s actually the solar eclipse. >> It would be very, very coincidental if we happened to fly through the shadow, because the shadow is very narrow. It could happen, but i mean-- >> the odds are against us. >> The odds are against us. So a lunar eclipse happens at the full moon. >> Okay. >> When, of course, the sun is on the other side of the earth and the moon is-- if you re standing on the earth, the sun is behind you, because it s nighttime, and you see the-- and a solar eclipse happens at a new moon, when the moon is-- you can t really see it in the sky, because you re seeing the dark side of the moon. >> So you ll never see a crescent moon in a lunar eclipse? >> No, no, it s definitely a full moon, so as full as it gets. Another thing is lunar and solar eclipses are often paired, because that tilt of the moon s orbit, the point when it crosses the earth-sun orbit plane, is on both sides. And so usually we get an accompanying lunar eclipse with a solar eclipse. And in fact, the accompanying lunar eclipse for this eclipse is on august 7th, and will be visible from europe, africa, asia, and australia. >> Oh, okay. Well, there you go. >> Or was visible, i guess. >> August 7th, yeah. I guess-- aw. >> You want me to say that again? [ Laughter ] >> if we could go back in time okay, so i mean, that s kind of from the perspective of earth, right? We ve got solar eclipses, and when the moon is in between us here on earth and the sun, and then the opposite for the lunar eclipse. In general, if you had to give like a general overview, where else in the universe do eclipses happen? >> Everywhere. >> How about that. >> Anywhere where you have bodies moving around, one will often eclipse the view of another. But usually, what you-- you won t get to see the amazing sight on earth, because it s very rare that the object eclipsing looks in the sky the same size as the sun. >> Oh. >> So we know, for instance, there are eclipses caused by jupiter s moons as it orbits jupiter, and you can see the shadow on the surface of jupiter-- or the clouds, actually, of jupiter. >> Right. >> And in fact, there was a fellow named ole r mer-- if i m pronouncing correctly-- back in the 1600s that first detected the finite speed of light by looking at the timing of those eclipses on jupiter. So that s one of those science things that eclipses have allowed us to do. >> That s amazing-- just by looking at shadows across the universe, you can get all this crazy science. >> And sometimes-- i know we ve done occultations of stars, where a planet moves between us and the starlight of a star, and by measuring that star, we ve seen, like-- we ve found the rings of uranus, as the star would twinkle or would blink out just before uranus crossed the star. >> Oh. >> So you can actually do things like look for difficult to see rings, or also, as the light comes through the atmosphere, sometimes you can see the absorption of different chemicals in the atmosphere of the planet. >> And then understand the composition of the planet itself. >> Exactly. >> That s amazing. >> Let me add one thing we hadn t talked about. >> Yeah, sure. >> I found an interesting statistic, and it said that if you picked a random spot on the earth and you just stayed right there, you would see a solar eclipse about once every 375 years, on average. >> Okay, so you should move a little bit. >> Yeah, well-- you re not following. [ Laughter ] so during a normal person s long lifetime-- say, 70 years-- we re looking at a 20-25% chance that you would sometime in your lifetime see an eclipse, a total eclipse of the sun. So yes, it s rare, but not totally unknown. >> Yeah. >> So i just know that one never comes by my house, so i have to go chase it down. [ Laughter ] >> well, that s the great thing, is we have nasa-- we folks at nasa are actually looking at this stuff and making predictions. We know exactly where it s going to be on august 21st. >> That s correct, that s right. >> Yeah, so that kind of will help you see it a little bit, too. [ Laughter ] i think one of my favorites, though, when it comes to eclipses across the universe, is kepler, right? So if you think about-- you said occultations as one of them. That s when something passes in front of a star and changes the light that we re receiving. >> Right. >> That s how we are detecting planets outside of our solar system, correct? >> That s correct, yeah. The kepler mission is looking at a large group of stars and monitoring them constantly. And it has very, very sensitive instruments, so they can look at very small dips in the light as a planet-- a previously unknown planet-- transits the face of that star. And we ve been able-- and when they see them repeating, they can work out the relative sizes of the planets and their period, and work out where they are in orbit around that star. And we ve seen-- i don t know what the count is-- a thousand? >> Yeah, yeah. We keep finding more and more. >> There s a bunch of them. So this is actually one of the most interesting discoveries, i think, astronomers have made in the last several years, is that our galaxy is full of stars with planets. And it s pretty exciting-- it s kind of star trek stuff. >> It is! Especially just recently, the discovery of the trappist-1 system. >> Yes, indeed. >> And those-- we re talking about earth-like planets, and some of which are in what we like to call the goldilocks zone, right? >> That s right. >> And that s-- you know, water doesn t freeze, it doesn t-- >> that s right, it s not too hot, not too cold. >> Not too cold, right, and liquid water can exist. And that s conditions for life, and it s very exciting. >> It is. >> That s what we re looking for, right-- life outside of the universe. >> And i ll also mention we also have transits here, just like what we see with kepler, of the planets mercury and venus, which are inside the orbit of earth. And we recently had a venus transit visible from the us. >> Yeah, 2012, right?? >> That s right, i think it was 2012. And i ve also seen mercury transits as well. Those have an interesting history, because scientists in the 18th century were trying-- they d figured out the relative distance to the different planets, but they didn t know an absolute distance. And they were actually going to use different observers on the earth to measure the transit of venus to try and get an absolute scale. And so that was the cutting edge science in the 18th century. >> Wow. [ Laughter ] >> but so that s another point where transits and eclipses have been an important part of the history of science. >> Amazing. I mean, that s kind of a big theme here, right, especially for eclipses, is the science that we can get from observing these phenomena. >> That s right. >> So i mean, from here on the ground, what are some of the things that we can learn-- and i guess in the instance of a solar eclipse, but you know, eclipses in general-- what are some of the things that we can learn from studying these? >> Well, let s kind of go through some of the discoveries that were made with eclipses. >> Sure. >> So from ecl-- we all look up at the sun and see a bright disk. That s called the photosphere. It s very, very bright, and we ll talk about that a little bit. That s the part we re familiar with. It s about 10,000 degrees fahrenheit-- it s nice and hot. But during eclipses, astronomers notice some red layer-- a thin red layer around the sun. And that s known as the chromosphere. And that was discovered by eclipses, and it turns out chromosphere is due to emissions from atomic hydrogen in the sun s atmosphere. >> Okay. >> And so if you-- the soho spacecraft sometimes show-- i mean-- the soho spacecraft show-- is constantly monitoring the sun. And one of its instruments is a hydrogen alpha filter, and you can see what that chromosphere looks like. It s a very thin layer of the sun, again, that we discovered by looking at eclipses. The next section-- oh, by the way, some scientists-- in 1868, there was a new instrument that was developed called the spectroscope. And the spectroscope splits light into its component colors. And they had discovered that there were specific lines, almost like a fingerprint, that defined-- that were unique to each chemical, to each chemical element. >> Okay. >> And so there were-- some scientists were very excited to use the spectroscope to look at the eclipse. And in the chromosphere, they saw some lines from an element that they had never seen before. And they couldn t figure out what it was. So one of the scientists named it after the greek word for the sun-- helios. They named it helium. >> Oh! [ Laughter ] >> and it was several decades before helium was finally isolated and studied on the earth, but it was first discovered in the sun s atmosphere. >> How about that. That s-- is it called spectroscopy? >> Spectroscopy, yeah. They use a spectroscope for spectroscopy. >> Yeah, yeah, and studying the-- i guess there s little gaps in the light, and they look like gaps in the-- >> sometimes there s bright lines, sometimes there s dark lines. >> Okay. >> It depends on the situation. But the point is these lines are like a fingerprint. And that s how we understand the components of stars millions of lightyears away. We can-- >> so you said photosphere, and then you discovered the chromosphere, right? >> Chromosphere. >> So what s the difference between those? >> Well, the chromosphere is actually a very thin layer-- it s actually-- starts as cooler than the photosphere, and then it heats up again. >> Ooh. >> Solar astronomers are always trying to figure out the exact details, but what gets interesting is when you look up at the eclipse when it s total eclipse, there s what looks like a halo, or a garland, or a crown around it, and that s called the corona. So the chromosphere s a transition between the hot photosphere and the much hotter corona. And the corona is up to-- it s more than 100 times hotter than the photosphere. It s very, very hot. >> Wow. >> And that s, like i said, this halo that you see around the sun. That is actually very important-- to monitor that part of the sun-- in predicting solar storms. >> Oh. >> And solar storms affect things like satellites and our communication and our power systems. And so there are solar astronomers who are constantly monitoring the sun looking for these types of solar storms. But the corona was discovered by looking at eclipses. >> Wow. >> And in fact, it s so important that we ve launched satellites that create artificial eclipses. They put a little obstacle in the way so that we can monitor the chromosphere-- i m sorry, the corona-- at all times. >> So i guess, are they hard to predict, solar storms? >> They re getting better at it. The big thing is they need to be able to see on the far side of the sun. So we ve actually launched a couple of spacecraft called stereo, and they re now on the far side of the sun-- not totally-- they re part way around the earth s orbit, but they can see the other parts of the sun, and we can see storms developing as the sun rotates around. The sun actually rotates, also. >> Wow. So what happens if-- say there s an instance, if there s a solar storm, and it does disrupt satellite communications coverage, whatever it is. What can we expect if that were to happen? Are you talking about cell phones? Are you talking about-- what would happen here on earth? >> Well, one of the worst things we re worried about is a really, really big solar storm which could knock out power grids in certain areas. >> Wow. >> And so you could actually have power outages. >> That s heavy. >> But usually satellites, they put them in safe mode. But it can damage satellites. And as you know, telecommunications is a multi-million dollar business. >> Right. >> So there s a lot of interest in solar storms. >> But they have a safe mode to-- >> yep, that s right. >> That s amazing, okay. So they just put it in there if they see something bad coming. >> It s still dangerous, but they can put it in a safer mode. [ Laughter ] one other thing that was observed during eclipses is there s sometimes these little arcs-- they re not little-- they re bigger than the earth, but these little arcs of plasma jutting off the sun. And you ve probably seen pictures of them. They look like arches or flames coming off the sun. >> Yeah. >> They re called prominences, and they re plasma in the strong magnetic field of the sun moving through the atmosphere. And they re really quite spectacular. >> Yeah, i ve seen some images and videos of them-- they really are. It s amazing. >> Again, those were discovered by eclipses. And i ll tell you another set of experiments. It turned out that by the mid 1800s, scientists had started working out the mathematics of planets, and had noticed when a planet gets perturbed and sort of gets nudged a little bit, they said, well, that must mean another planet that s tugging on it with its gravity. And that s how neptune was discovered. They saw the perturbation in the motion of uranus. And they noticed that there was a slight perturbation in the orbit of mercury. So scientists began speculating that that was due to another planet even closer in to the sun, which they nicknamed vulcan. So what happened was they then sent-- in the 1860s and 1870s, scientists deployed around the world for some eclipses to try and look for vulcan. And they didn t find anything, which puzzled them. They looked at multiple eclipses, multiple times-- no vulcan. But in 1915, albert einstein began publishing-- began communicating his work on the general theory of relativity. And einstein had postulated that gravity is caused by the bending of spacetime. And one of his-- one of his-- one of the predictions of his theory was that you would see this perturbation of the orbit of mercury. So he explained that with his general theory of relativity. But another prediction was that this bending of spacetime would actually bend light. So he showed why there wasn t a vulcan, but then he said, if you look at an eclipse of the sun, and look at the light of stars very, very close to the disk of the sun, you should be able to see the light bent in a way that it displaces the apparent position of the star. In 1919, arthur eddington, the british astronomer, deployed for an eclipse out on an island in the atlantic ocean. And they actually measured this slight change in the apparent position of the stars. And it was a huge event, because when einstein postulated his theory of general relativity, it was crazy. It was overturning newton. And here they actually-- his prediction turned true, and that s sort of what propelled einstein into his fame, was that discovery. So that was perhaps the most important scientific discovery ever during an eclipse, was showing how the light of stars is bent by the presence of the mass of the sun. >> And that-- so it was just the mass of the sun. >> That's right. >> And there was no vulcan. >> No vulcan. [ Laughter ] although, there are two eclipse stories related, sort of quasi-related to the same thing there. >> But everything comes together, right? That s why we re-- like, going back to the general theme here, a lot of science to learn from eclipses. >> A lot of science. Let me talk about a couple things that are going on with the science this time around. >> Okay. >> We have one group that s going to have a series of telescopic cameras set up along the eclipse path. And they re going to try and take video of the inner corona, which is very difficult to see except during the eclipse. And the idea is one camera will record a little segment of the inner corona, and the next camera will record the next segment, and they can stitch them together and have a rather extended video of the corona. >> Oh. >> So for scientists who study the interaction of the corona. Another one is some other scientists are going to be studying the polarization. Some light is polarized in different directions that tells us information about the magnetic fields and other things. But they re going to be looking at the spectrum and the polarization of the-- again, the inner corona, which is difficult to measure in other ways, because it s difficult to get so close-- to measure such dim phenomena so close to the disk of the sun. >> And this is-- going back, i m sorry-- you might ve already addressed this, but these are nasa telescopes, or these are others? >> It s a variety of-- nasa s cooperating on some of these, and some of them are universities, and some of them are amateur. So it s actually a whole team of different kinds of people. >> Wow, okay. >> Nasa s helping to coordinate some of these. >> Yeah, all working together, okay. Cool. >> We ve got another group that are actually going to repeat the general theory of relativity experiment with some more modern digital equipment with more sensitive cameras to look for some very dim stars, again, to try and fine tune those measurements to see how close einstein got to the prediction. >> Wow. >> And then, we also have some radio enthusiasts who are-- during the daylight, the sun ionizes gas in the upper atmosphere and we have an ionosphere. And it, both enhances and sometimes interferes with radio communications. So these scientists are going to look at how the ionosphere changes as the sun gets eclipsed, and the sunlight starts to drop off, and then go back up again. So, they re going to observe how the ionosphere changes. >> Interesting. >> So lots of interesting experiments. And of course-- and many of these are by these amatuer citizen scientists, which is kind of a fun thing, too. >> Yeah, absolutely. So, we re measuring the earth s atmosphere, we re measuring a lot of about the sun. >> Mm-hmm. >> I know out of here, the wb-57, those high altitude planes, they re going to be flying above most of the atmosphere, about 90% of it, and they re going to take a look at the sun and study the sun s corona. >> Yeah, a bit. >> And measure how energy goes through the sun s atmosphere, but then also take a look at mercury. >> Oh, that s right. >> Yeah. >> I wanted to tell you, when you see the eclipse you will see a number of planets visible in the sky. >> Oh. >> So, if you get a chance, you ll see stars. Venus is off to the west, mars is even closer. It s-- venus is about 35 degrees to the west, mars is about 10 degrees to the west, mercury s about 10 degrees to the east, and jupiter s way over on the other side of the sky at 60 degrees to the east. And the star, regulus, which is a bright star, will be about 5 degrees to the east of the sun, so you can see if you can see that. >> And this will happen during totality, right? >> During totality, because the stars will come out. >> Wow, amazing. So you ll be able to see all of these, and you re talking about from the perspective if you re looking up and-- the sun-- >> right. >> Once it goes to totality-- and we can get to safety in a minute, but i do know, once it gets to totality you can take off your glasses for about that two minutes, right? >> That s right. Yeah. >> And then, that s when you ll be able to see all those different parts. >> Yes. >> That s really cool. >> Yeah, that s it. Let s talk a little about the history, because there s some interesting history, of course. >> Sure, yeah. >> The most famous story, which is probably legendary, but the story about a chinese astronomer, or possibly two chinese astronomers, named xi he, who was hired by the king. He was the high astronomer, the head astronomer. >> Mm-hmm. >> To make predictions about primarily with astrology to make sure that nothing bad was going to happen to the king. Well, apparently there was a solar eclipse he did not predict. >> Oh. >> And apparently, he had had a little too much to drink and he wasn t on the job when the time came. >> Oh. >> And the chinese actually thought, and a lot of ancient cultures thought, that something bad was happening. The chinese thought a dragon was swallowing the sun, and they would bang on pots and pans to scare the dragon away. And that s actually still practiced in many parts of the world, the bang on pots and pans. >> Yeah, they don t know the-- like, the science behind this total solar eclipse, so they re-- >> that s right. >> Yeah, right, go ahead. >> I think part of this tradition is passed on. >> Yeah, tradition, yeah. >> Well, unfortunately, this poor chinese astronomer that didn t do his job, he got executed. >> Oh. >> So, fortunately, we don t hold our scientists to this same level there. >> I m very thankful of that. >> Yes. >> I m sure we are. Yeah. >> But, lots of ancient people were scared of eclipses because they thought they-- i mean, it s a very amazing thing to happen in the sky and they were worried about it. It s warning of some tragedy. >> Mm-hmm. >> So early scientists in multiple cultures-- the mayans, the babylonians, the chinese-- studied eclipses and tried to understand and predict when they would occur. It turned out there was a greek by the name of thales who predicted an eclipse in 585 b.c. And this was recorded and the greek historian, herodotus, there was a big battle going on between two countries. There were the medes and the lydians, in what s now turkey. >> Hmm. >> And there was a war going on and they had lined up for battle. And they were about to do battle and suddenly there was a solar eclipse. >> Oh. >> Os, needless to say, the two generals met in the middle of the field and said, maybe we ought not to fight today. And so they drew up a peace treaty and those two countries never fought again. So just a-- >> all right. So an example of solar eclipse saving lives. >> That s right. Indeed, indeed. And so, but what happened was, a lot of these-- as people began to learn to write things down-- the babylonians on clay tablets, and the chinese court records, and the greek historians-- people began to pull together this information to understand how to predict eclipses and understand how the cycles occur. And that helped the-- that sort of spawned the whole science of astronomy. How do you-- how d the mathematics occur on these objects. >> Hmm. >> And one of the things they discovered was called the saros cycle, and this actually-- edmond halley named it the saros cycle. They didn t-- they had different names in ancient times. But what they discovered was that an eclipse will recur approximately every 6,585.3 days, which is 18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours. So it turns out that the eclipse we re about to have is part of a saros cycle that occurred-- the last one was in europe in august 11, 1999, and the next one will be in asia and the pacific one september 2nd, 2035. And it looks almost exactly the same except shifted by 8 hours around the other, 123 degrees in longitude. >> Oh. >> So these repeating cycles were how the ancients were able to predict eclipses. >> How about that. Wow. >> And it s just all the different cycles of the sun and the moon add up to this repeating cycle of eclipses. >> Interesting. >> Another thing that science that was done in ancient times was the greeks looked up at a lunar eclipse-- when we re talking about how the moon moves into the shadow of the earth. And what they discovered is when the moon is near the horizon and eclipsed the shadow of the earth is not a line, if the earth were flat. It s still round. So the greeks realized that the earth must be a sphere based on-- based on the shadow of the earth on the moon under an eclipse. >> Oh, wow. >> So that was the first scientific discovery that the earth was indeed a sphere. >> Back in the mayan-- wow, okay. >> Back in the greek times, that was. >> Oh, that was greek times. >> Yeah, it was. >> Okay, okay. Interesting. Wow! >> There s a lot of interesting history associated with eclipses. >> Absolutely. >> That-- so we ve learned a lot through history. I mean, we re talking about, yeah, the shape of the earth. We re talking about-- it stopped a battle. >> Nature of the sun, yeah. >> The nature of the sun. >> Yup. The earliest eclipse that was-- that, as far as we know, was recorded, that chinese eclipse was probably about 2000 b.c. And there was maybe the one in 2137 b.c. But, the one we re sure about was there was an eclipse recorded in the town of ugerit, or ugarit, on-- in what is now, i believe, syria. >> Hmm. >> It was may 3rd, 1375 b.c. It was recorded that the sun grew dark. >> Oh. >> So there s a number of those recorded in ancient texts and tablets. >> Okay. So, wait, so the chinese one was not recorded? It was just-- >> well, just know it s actually probably semi legendary. We re not sure. >> Got it, okay. >> But this is the one we know for sure we can date the eclipse. >> Yeah. >> And actually-- oh, that was what i was going to tell you, is we have a number of these dated eclipses-- eclipse of thales, we talked about. >> Mm-hmm. >> Eclipse in ugarit. And what happens if you just run-- if you just take your computer models and putting gravity and everything and just run the sun and moon backwards in time, it turns out the eclipse is in the wrong place. So, from that, what we ve learned is that the earth rotation very, very gradually starting to slow down. >> Hmm. >> Starting to, it s been a long time. It s mainly due to the tidal effects of the moon. It s actually dragging the earth slightly down. So it s actually in those several thousand years the earth has slowed down a little bit, a fraction of an-- a fraction of a rotation. >> Oh. >> But, keep in mind, we re talking about-- we re talking about 800,000 rotations or something like that since those times. And so, we ve-- the earth s rotation has changed just a little bit in those times. But, that s another discovery we ve made that you need that long time scale to see this very gradual slowing down of the earth s rotation. >> So, over that long period of time, you said a fraction of a day, is it like an hour? Couple of hours? >> A couple of hours i think, yeah. >> Wow. >> But, and recently, some scientists have gone back and looked at chinese records, and again, been able to fine tune that. So that s a-- that s using ancient records to fine tune some modern science, so. >> All right. Cool. Okay, so let s go to this eclipse coming up on the 21st. >> All right, do you want to talk about safety or what to expect? >> All of it. Let s do it. >> All right. All right, let s talk about-- >> however you want to start. >> Let s talk about safety a little bit. >> Okay, safety. >> Okay, everybody has heard, don t look at an eclipse, you ll go blind, right? We ve all heard that. >> Yeah. >> And i remember as a boy, puzzling and puzzling over that. What is it about an eclipse that makes it so dangerous? >> Mm-hmm. >> Well, it turns out, you don t want to stare at the sun ever. It s bad for your eyes. Your eyes are not designed to be-- handle direct sunlight for any length of time. >> I feel like it s a good general rule. >> It s a good general rule. And when our kids go outside, we say, now, kids, don t look at the sun, you ll go blind. It s true, you don t want them looking at the sun. >> Yeah, yeah. >> The reason why-- the eclipse is not any different. It s just you're more likely to stare at the sun during an eclipse because you want to see what s happening. >> Oh. >> So, this really-- there s people that think there is some sort of mysterious rays coming off the sun. The only thing is just the sun like we're normally familiar with, you just don t want to stare at it. Okay. >> Okay. >> All right, so that s the first thing. So any time the bright disk, that photosphere of the sun, any time the bright disk is visible, even just a little sliver, you really don t want to look at the sun with your unaided eye. It s dangerous. You want to keep your eye for a long -- your eyes for a long time, right? >> Yeah, i would hope so. >> But we have special-- nowadays, we have special eclipse glasses that you can get in museums and different places. >> Yeah. >> That are-- it s perfectly safe to put those on and look. By the way, don t do what i did. I was checking my eclipse glasses the other day. I looked up at the sun, i said, yeah. And i pulled the eclipse glasses off before i stopped looking at the sun, so then i had a bright blob. Just for a second, i had a bright blob in my eyes for a little while. So be careful with them. They re often made of aluminized mylar and they look-- they re kind of silvery. >> Okay. >> And also, don t put any pinholes or anything in them. That-- you want to-- you want to keep them like they are. >> Keep them-- so what are the special eclipse glasses? They have-- they re just like really intense sunglasses? Is that kind of what i think? >> Yeah, it s kind of super sunglasses. >> Okay. >> Which here s the thing, you want to avoid any homemade glasses. >> Oh. >> Don t put on multiple sunglasses or something. Don t use smoked glass, or photographic film, or neutral density filters, or anything like that. You re not sure there s enough there to block the light to make it safe. >> Okay. >> So stick with the-- with the-- with the kind that you can get. They re not very expensive and you can-- you can get them online and other places. >> Okay. >> One exception is number 14 welder s glass is safe, because that s designed also for very bright. Like the welders use. >> Oh, okay. >> All right, so that s okay. And the-- and even more important part is don t look at the sun-- don t look at the bright disk of the sun with any instruments, with telescopes or binoculars without proper filters on them, because those things actually magnify the strength of the sun. >> Ooh. They ll your-- >> and just like when i was a boy, i used to use the magnifying glass on the ants, you know? That could do that to your eye, so you need to be very, very careful. >> Yeah. >> So i would avoid-- i would avoid those, unless you have properly designed equipment. Now, don t like take your binoculars and put your sunglasses at the eyepiece, because it s so intense it could burn right through your special glasses. So there s-- be very, very careful unless you know what you re doing with binoculars and telescopes. Don t even use those. >> Right, and that s, again, that s only a two minute eclipse. >> It s only a two and a half minute at the most. >> Yeah. >> So, that s-- that little window of time during totality, after the moon has completely covered the disk of the sun-- >> mm-hmm. >> --That is the only time you can look safely without glasses. >> Okay. >> And it-- and the brightness of the-- of the eclipsed sun and the corona-- it s like the brightness of a full moon, so there s no dangerous rays. You just don t want to be staring at the sun when the sun re-emerges. So, okay. So, just good rules of thumb. >> So, when you re looking at it-- say you have the glasses on. >> Mm-hmm. >> Is there a specific amount of time that we can say is safe to have the glasses on and be looking at the moon about to cover the sun? >> Well, what s going to happen-- >> you don t want to stare at it for hours. >> No, no. Well, what you re probably looking for is as the sun-- as the very last piece of the sun starts to disappear, you ll see actually little dots that form, and those are called baily s beads. >> Hmm. >> And it s an interesting phenomena of what-- it has to do with the different brightnesses on the edge of the sun, and also the mountains on the moon. >> Mm-hmm. >> When those disappear, that s the time you can take your glasses off and-- so you don t want to be-- because that s actually tiny little pieces of the photosphere of the sun. >> Right. >> Oh, there s the other way-- if you don t have the glasses, there s some other ways you can look at-- and it s-- by the way, if you re seeing a partial eclipse, you just want to use the glasses. You don t want to look at the sun directly. >> Will you be able to see the moon partially covering the sun with the glasses? >> Yes, it ll look like a cookie with a bite taken out of it. >> How about that. That s cool. >> That s pretty cool. One method you probably heard of is a pinhole projector, and it s very easy to make. You need some opaque material, like cardboard, and you make a pinhole, and then you project onto like a white sheet of paper an image of the sun. A pinhole acts like a lens. And i think it s important, don t actually look through the pinhole with your eye. It s not intended to look inside. It s a projector. It s a little projector. >> You look at the paper. >> You look at the paper and you ll see a little image of the sun with that. And you can see the progress of the eclipse. Another method i used to do when i was in high school, is if you take a very small mirror or a large mirror with a piece of paper with a circular hole cut out, and you can reflect the image on the sun-- of the sun onto a shaded wall, and you can watch the eclipse that way. >> Oh. >> And i tell the story, i was in-- i was in history class when there was an eclipse of the sun when i was in high school, and i asked the teacher, i said, is it okay if i put this in the window and we can watch the eclipse during class time? The teacher said, okay. So we put it in the window and it put an image of the sun during the eclipse up on the ceiling. We just went along with class and you could watch the progress of the eclipse. >> All right. >> So those are-- so the mirror, there s the projector, or your glasses are the three ways to watch the eclipse. And then, the only time, again, to watch the sun-- watch the eclipse unaided is during totality, that little short period of time. >> Okay, and totality is by far the most narrow section of the u.s. >> That s right. >> So you really have to be in that spot and we-- you can go to the website eclipse2017.nasa.gov and find out exactly where that s going to be passing through. >> That s right. And it starts-- i think i started this, but it comes on the west coast. >> Oh, right. >> It arrives in oregon, it goes across oregon, idaho, wyoming, nebraska, missouri, kentucky, tennessee, south carolina. It s a nice path that goes right through the middle of the united states. >> All right. >> And it s a relatively narrow-- relatively narrow path and, of course, it s actually moving. It s a round shadow that s moving across the surface of the earth. >> Mm-hmm. >> And if you re actually anywhere in that band you will see a total eclipse. The closer you are to the center, the longer it will last. Up to a max of two and a half minutes. >> All right. >> The other thing though is the weather. >> Oh, yeah. >> Yeah. So, it turns out that what eclipse aficionados like to do is they ll look at the historical weather at that point in the u.s. At that time of year and it turns out some of the areas are more likely to have-- to have clouds than others. So it turns out, eastern oregon is a really good place. They tend to have nice clear weather at that time of year. >> Okay. >> Wyoming, nebraska, missouri, all the way to tennessee, tend to be pretty cloud free at that time of year. And then, there s another-- as it goes over the appalachians, they tend to be cloudier. And then the little section of south carolina will also have, hopefully, less clouds than other places. But again, you never know. It;s the weather. >> Yeah. Oh, yeah. >> All you can do is roll the dice and figure-- and hope that you re lucky, because if-- there have been many eclipses that people have gone-- scientists have gone specific trips to see and it s been interfered-- the weather interferes. >> Yeah, that s just-- yeah, poor luck. But that s based on data of this day over time at this place. >> That s right. How often has it been cloudy on this day at this place. >> Yeah, and so you re really rolling the dice, but playing the odds. But those based on statistical data are better off than others. >> Right. >> Very cool. Is there any particular spot during the path of totality that may be would be better? Like, for example, is it better to go to like a state park and be away from city lights or anything? Or is being in the city just as fine? >> It s just as fine. >> Okay. >> It doesn t get totality dark during an eclipse. >> Okay. >> It gets dark, but i don t think that s-- i don t think that part of it is particularly important. >> Okay. >> The main thing, it s actually much more practical, you want to be somewhere where you re close to restrooms. >> Okay. >> The eclipse itself lasts three hours and there may be a lot of traffic, so the ability to get around maybe limited. >> Ooh, yeah. >> So, just very practical things-- are you close to food> are you close to supplies? Things like that. >> Mm-hmm. >> So let s talk a little bit about what to expect. >> Yeah. >> As i said, there may be a lot of heavy traffic so you want to get to where you want to go early. >> Okay. >> And bring things that you re going to need-- your glasses-- your eclipse glasses, a camera if you re going to bring a camera, chairs, sunscreen, water, food, toilet paper, anything that you think you might need while you re on the road. >> Wow, yeah. >> I once had to evacuate here in houston during hurricane rita, and it s maybe a little bit like that and may be stuck on the road with heavy traffic if you re not careful. >> Wow! Are you talking about people stopping on the highway just to-- >> no, just talking about large numbers of people moving to see the eclipse. >> To see-- to be in the path of totality. >> If you re traveling-- for instance, i m going to be in the carolinas. >> Mm-hmm. >> And every eclipse watched on the atlantic coast is going to be headed for south carolina. >> Yeah. >> So the interstates are going to be pretty full. >> Wow. >> So just allow plenty of time. The total eclipse-- i mean, the entire eclipse lasts about three hours, so it s about an hour and a half leading up to totality and an hour and a half until the moon completely uncovers the sun. >> Okay, okay. >> But again, i-- and one of the things i thought was interesting was the eclipse veterans gave some very sage advice. They said, if this is your first eclipse, don t try to photograph it. Don t try to take telephotos of it. You ll be so worried about your camera, you ll miss the spectacular nature of the eclipse. So i think that s good advice. And so, if you re a veteran eclipse guy and you want to-- and you want to make photographs of things, that s fine. >> Yeah. >> Let the professionals do it. Just enjoy the experience. >> Yeah. >> I think that s a good idea. >> I m sure there s going to be plenty of imagery coming out from all over the u.s. >> Oh, there will. I bet there s going to be lots of selfies with people with the moon and the eclipsed sun behind them. But that s fine. >> Do you think selfies will come out, at least during totality? Maybe when it s dark enough it ll be okay. >> You may need a flash on yourself. >> Oh, okay. A flash on yourself, okay. >> A couple of suggestions to do, so a little citizen science you can do. >> Okay. >> One of them is, notice how the sky colors change. >> Hmm. >> They re very unusual colors that you don t normally see, so that s an interesting thing. Also, when there s a tree casting shadows, there are lots of little tiny holes between the leaves that act like pinhole cameras. So sometimes you can see little crescent suns during the partial eclipse on the ground. So you can look for that. It s kind of fun to take pictures of that. >> Oh, that s really cool. >> Does the temperature change? Does it feel cooler during the eclipse? Does the wind pick up or calm down during the eclipse? Just some kind of scientific things you can observe. >> Just is there-- are there things that we know of that-- what atmospheric changes in the earth? Like-- >> it will-- it does change the heating of the earth from the sun. >> Oh, it does? >> Yeah, and you will feel colder. And people actually have noticed it feels considerably cooler, which will be pleasant probably on august 21st, especially in south carolina. So just things to notice. Again, the other thing is as totality approaches observers have sometimes noticed what s called shadow bands, and these are alternating light and dark bands that quickly move across the ground, especially where you have light colored surfaces. >> Hmm. >> They occur just before totality and after totality. They re-- actually, we don t fully understand how they work. They probably have something to do with the atmosphere, the same reason the stars twinkle. But if you can see them-- sometimes they re seen, and sometimes they re not. Something to look for. >> Hmm. >> Another thing to observe is right a s the totality is beginning, there s just a tiny little sliver of the sun, and it looks very much like a diamond ring in the sky, and it s called the diamond ring effect. And that s definitely when the diamond ring occurs at the end of the eclipse. So the baily s beads-- that s the time to put your sunglasses-- your special eclipse glasses back on. >> Oh, okay. >> But, as the eclipse is about to happen you ll see the diamond ring effect, and then the diamond will go away, the baily s beads will go away, and then you ll see the full totality. And again, you can take your eclipse glasses off during totality, but be ready to put them back on. >> Yeah. >> And another thing you can look around is take a moment-- while you re enjoying the eclipse, take a moment to observe people around you. See how people react to it. >> Yeah. >> The expressions on their face. Another thing, is sometimes animals behave strangely during eclipses. >> Chicken shave been known to roost, birds behave differently. Even wasps and bees sometimes behave strangely. >> Wow. >> Cows, insect-- dogs, insects, anything you can think of that s close by, just for fun, observe and see if you notice anything. >> It is a strange and rare phenomenon to them. >> It is strange and they re confused by it. >> Yeah, yeah. >> And by the way, after totality, the whole sequence will reverse it. So you have all those sequence of things, the partial eclipse, the diamond ring, the baily s beads. >> Mm-hmm. >> And that will reverse as the moon uncovers the sun. >> Wow. Amazing. >> So if you miss this eclipse, or the weather doesn t cooperate, we have another chance in 7 years from now. >> All right. >> In 2024, there will be an eclipse that will move through texas and up through new england, and it will be another total eclipse of the sun. So we have two in a very short period of time, but it s been a long time since we ve had an eclipse. >> All right, yeah. >> So, we re due. We re due. We get two-- so, two chances, and my wife said, well, why don t we just go to the one in 7 years? And i said, well, we don t know what our lives are going to be like in 7 years. >> Yeah. >> So i said, carpe eclipsum. Seize the eclipse. So this is your chance. >> Fantastic. Yeah, no, i mean, i m-- if anything, why not both, right? >> Well, why not? We can try both. I may become an eclipse junkie, i guess. >> Yeah, yeah. No, i mean, it s so cool. And the fact that we re able to predict them, and we can go and-- we have a bunch of best practices on how you can observe the eclipse, the best that you can possibly do it. >> Yeah. >> I know, going back, just one quick thing. Well, you said early. Arrive to your destination early. >> Yeah, if you can, yes. >> How early are you-- are you talking about like days, or day, or hours? >> Well, it s difficult to arrive days early now, because virtually every hotel is booked along the eclipse path. >> Oh. >> We re going to be some distance away from the eclipse, so we re going to have to start early. The eclipse is maximum in south carolina about 2:30, so i figure if we get off at 8:00 in the morning that gives us about 6 hours to get there. And that may or may not be enough time. We ll just have to do the best we can. That was just where we-- i m staying with relatives, so that s-- >> okay. >> But, a lot of people i know have their hotel rooms booked in the-- at-- underneath the eclipse, so they can just step outside and watch it. >> Yeah, that s the-- oh, i wish i planned ahead there. That would ve been nice just get a nice, like, resort or something and just lay by the pool, watch the eclipse go by. That d be pretty cool. >> Actually, what i had originally planned-- i ve been planning for this eclipse since i was in graduate school many, many years ago. >> Wow. >> And i noticed that it would actually go through grand teton national park. And i thought, that s what i ll do. I ll go to the grand tetons and see the eclipse. But it turns out, the weather s not so-- it s a higher probability of clouds there, so i backed away from that. >> Wow. >> Good luck to those of you that-- the tetons. But that would be a beautiful photograph, actually, to see the eclipse over the grand tetons. >> Oh, absolutely. Let s keep our fingers crossed for that good weather all across the board. >> Hopefully it ll be clear all across the united states. >> Yeah. >> And everybody will be able to enjoy the eclipse. >> That would be fantastic. Well, i think that s all the time we have, unless you have one more story. But-- anything? >> I have other stories, but-- there are lots of good stories. >> Well, hey, yeah. Actually, we have a website and if you stay tuned until after the music here, we ll tell you where you can go and check out some more info on the eclipse and learn a little bit more about the history, the science, and all kinds of cool stuff, including the citizen science that mark was talking about here and how you can-- what you can do to observe some phenomena about this eclipse. So stay tuned for after the music there. Mark, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. >> You re welcome. >> I feel like that was-- i m not going to say everything about the eclipse, because like you said, there s definitely more. But that s the-- i feel like i have a good understanding about eclipses and the science that goes behind it. So there s a lot about eclipses and a lot that we can learn just from shadows, and it s just amazing that there s so much behind it. So thanks for coming on the podcast and talking all about it. And everyone, i hope you enjoy the eclipse on the august 21st. So thanks again, mark. >> Thank you. [ Music ] >> houston, go ahead. >> I m on the space shuttle. >> Roger, zero-g and i feel fine. >> Shuttle has cleared the tower. >> We came in peace for all mankind. >> It s actually a huge honor to break the record like this. >> Not because they are easy, but because they are hard. >> Houston, welcome to space. >> Hey, thanks for sticking around. So, once again, this monday, august 21st, a total solar eclipse will sweep across america. If you want to know all the information that we have, if this podcast was not enough for you, go to eclipse2017.nasa.gov. You can find out all the science of eclipses, even more than we talked about with mark matney today, where it will be, and then how to safely view it from the ground. Just be sure to make sure that you check the glasses and make sure that they are nasa certified. After talking with mark matney after the show, we found out that the shadow itself is going to be 68 miles wide, and then that shadow travels faster than 1,000 miles per hour. So, he went back and he was trying to find the width of the shadow. It s actually a little bit smaller than you would imagine, but how fast it travels-- i mean, we re talking about some of those planes that are going to be following the shadow and studying it, they re only going to get only a few extra minutes out of it because the shadow s traveling so fast. But, if you think about it, it s the moon going around the earth, so it s probably going to be a little bit faster than you would think. Anyway, you can find out more about the eclipse by following us on social media. Obviously, our nasa accounts will be talking about this, but also here at the nasa johnson space center you can follow our accounts there. We ll be talking about it. If you follow international space station you can see some of the imagery. You ll get from there 250 miles above the earth. And then also, aries astral materials research, you ll find them on multiple accounts and you can talk-- they will be talking mostly about the science of eclipses, and they are also based here in the johnson space center. All of these are on either facebook, twitter, and instagram. If you want to join the conversation for-- and maybe submit some pictures that you are taking from wherever you re going to be observing the eclipse, and then also sort of see what everyone else is doing, the official hashtag for this event is #eclipse2017. Just use that on your favorite platform and share your experience and maybe ask a couple questions in case all of the information we told you today and anything you can t find on the website we can still answer even more questions that you have. So this podcast was recorded on july 19th, 2017. Thanks to alex perryman, john stoll, and tracy calhoun. And thanks again to dr. Mark matney for coming on the show. We ll be back next week."

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 144, “Space Hygiene,” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. One of the top questions, if not, the top question, that NASA receives from kids and really from people around the world is. How do you go to the bathroom in space? We get questions like this all the time. Other popular ones are. How do you eat? How do you talk to your family? How do you sleep? I think we get these questions so often, because they're so relatable, things we do in our own lives every day. So, in space, when it comes to hygiene, you can probably guess that it's something that the crew is prepared to do and has trained on how to do these things and use these systems on Earth before they even get to space. And, there's a lot to it. Because a lot of what you and I take for granted, becomes a whole lot harder in space; showering, shaving, doing laundry. Is there even laundry? Here to talk about space hygiene are the very people that train astronauts on how to take care of themselves in space. On today's episode is Elisca Hicks and Mike Berrill. They're Crew Systems Instructors. Elisca with Leidos and Mike with KBR, based here at NASA's Johnson Space Center. And, they're here to answer some of the most popular questions about living in space. So here we go. Going to the bathroom in space and overall space hygiene with Elisca Hicks and Mike Berrill. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Elisca and Mike, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Elisca Hicks: Thank you, super excited.  Mike Berrill: Thank you for having us.  Host: Yes. This is such an interesting topic, space hygiene. I was telling -- Elisca I was telling you a little bit before. When I was thinking about how to ask you these questions, I thought about two things. I thought, what do I know about the International Space Station and all the systems and what it takes to be an astronaut? And, then I swept around my own home and I was thinking about, you know, brushing my teeth, you know, washing my hair, flossing, these weird things that I know I do in my home, what is that like in space? And, so I hope we can all jam this, jam this together.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. Definitely things that you take for granted and you don't really think about how they're impacted in spaceflight.  Mike Berrill: Definitely.  Host: So, you're kind of like the space hygiene experts here at Johnson Space Center. How did you get started? Elisca, we'll start with you. How'd you get started and how'd you end up in space hygiene?  Elisca Hicks: Wow. OK. So quickly, I actually went to school to be a teacher, a physics teacher. And, moved around quite a bit, actually worked at Space Center Houston in their education department. Then I got picked up by the Space Medicine Group here at Johnson Space Center doing training and coordinating lots of medical students and flight surgeons in the Army, Navy, and Air Force to come for different training events. And, then I got picked up by Crew Systems here just about two years ago. And, I'm loving it.  Host: So, your strong expertise is actually in your ability to teach people, more so maybe than the technical things.  Elisca Hicks: Actually, that is exactly what happened.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: So as an instructor here at JSC, one of the qualifications is typically either that you are, have an education degree or some kind of other speaking type of careers plus have some science background as well. So, yeah.  Host: That's interesting. See I would've -- my first thought is that it would be flip flopped, that you would need the technical expertise and ah you're pretty good at talking to people --  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: -- So, we'll make you an instructor. But, it's actually, that is really critical for training people, is to have a really strong foundation in talking to people.  Elisca Hicks: Right. So, one of the things that, I think, folks notice is that engineers like to go into a whole lot of detail. And, as an instructor, you have to take all that information and what is it exactly that a crew member really needs to know? And, so we kind of have an ability to work together and come up with a lesson plan and things that we want to tell the crew for sure.  Host: Now Mike, are you flip flopped, or are you?  Mike Berrill: I'm a little bit different.  Host: Yeah. OK.  Mike Berrill: So, I actually started out in the military. I was in the US Navy in the aviation community. Working on planes, turning wrenches, if you will. After my first tour, I got out of the military and went into school and got my mechanical engineering degree. So, I am that technical side of things.  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: I was lucky enough to get picked up here at JSC after graduating and I been in Crew Systems ever since.  Host: Wow. OK. So, what do you take, what do you learn from Elisca about the training, the people side of things?  Mike Berrill: Well, she's absolutely correct. You know, you can be super smart from a technical engineering standpoint. But, if you can't teach the information to someone, you're not going to be effective. So, we, especially in Crew Systems, we really have to find the best of both worlds, you know, learning the technical knowledge and then being able to teach it to your students, in this case, crew members. Right? So.  Host: Let's dive into that. What's Crew Systems? What is this thing that you're teaching?  Mike Berrill: Perfect. Yeah. So, we deal with a lot of different things, primarily hygiene and habitability stuff. Historically, we also do a little bit of crew escape, so a lot of the new stuff coming along for us as our Commercial Crew Programs. So, we're going to teach crew members how to do, you know, water survival and crew escape stuff, as well. But, you know, we're more than just instructors, as well. We actually do monitor real time operations over in Mission Control. So, all the systems we're going to talk about today we actually monitor real time. If there's any issues, we'll help with those types of problems, as well.  Host: I find that a lot from a lot of the guests, is there's -- there's not, there's very few, if any, people that just wear one single hat. It's like I teach just the bathroom system and that's it. No, you're wearing all kinds of hats.  Mike Berrill: Very flexible.  Elisca Hicks: Yep.  Host: Yeah. And, it seems like you have to. You have to have that strong foundation.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: So, is there, are you doing the same thing Elisca? Are you teaching all, basically these same systems?  Elisca Hicks: Yes. So, I'm more on the habitability side of the Crew Systems. So how to eat, how to use the PWD, the Portable Water Dispenser, how to use the food warmer? We have, you know, items that are like the refrigerator onboard, they're called the [Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator] MERLIN currently right now. So, all of that plus just day to day type of living and what equipment and things do you have available to make life a little easier for you on space station.  Host: Perfect.  Elisca Hicks: But, we also again, monitor real time stuff. So, if we have items such as an issue with our crew quarters or with our Portable Water Dispenser, we're there as the subject matter experts as well, to help the people who actually sit in the front room's in mission control.  Host: So, you're alluding to a lot of these systems that we're going to be talking about today.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: The Portable Water System.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: I know we're going to talk about the bathroom at some point.  Mike Berrill: We're definitely going to talk about the bathroom.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Elisca Hicks: We're going to talk about the bathroom.  Host: Yeah. So, these are, these are very important, you say habitability, that's the word you use.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: It's just living in space.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: You got it.  Host: So, what am I missing here? We got water, we got the bathroom. What other things? Maybe the oxygen generation, I don't know what we're talking about here.  Elisca Hicks: That's a whole another system.  Host: That's a whole another system?  Elisca Hicks: The Environmental Control Life Support System Group.  Host: Got it.  Elisca Hicks: But, we do interface with those systems because, as you know, we recycle all of our urine and wastewater and everything into drinking water.   Mike Berrill: Absolutely.   Elisca Hicks: So, yeah, so there's, I'll let Mike definitely talk about that part. But, you know, the pee goes in and then the ecosystem does its thing and then, later on.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: What's the saying? Today's coffee is tomorrow's coffee -- something like that.  Mike Berrill: Yeah. Yesterday's coffee is today's coffee, exactly. [Laughter]  Host: You're basically drinking the same coffee over and over.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. [Laughter]  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: OK. All right. So, let's take me through a class. Let's say you're teaching me how to live in space. What are some of the things you're going over?  Mike Berrill: Right. So, one of the big things, and you kind of alluded to it in your intro about how you went through your house and kind of, how did they, how do these things happen in space? Right? A lot of the things we take for granted here on the ground use gravity. Right? So, we put ourselves in that microgravity situation and everything gets turned upside down if you will. Right? Seemingly easy tasks here on the ground become a little bit more challenging to the point to where things could get messy. So, a lot of, a lot of our, you know, classes go into the detail of here's the system and then also, hey here's how they actually do these things or use these things up in orbit, when it can become quite challenging. And, you know, part of my job is actually how to potty train astronauts. So that's pretty fun.  Host: How does that even work? Where do you even start? They come into a building I guess, next to a system. What's bathroom training like?  Mike Berrill: Right. Exactly. Yeah, so we actually interface out of a couple different buildings here at JSC.  Host: OK.  Mike Berrill: The primary one would be over in building 9, I like to call it the big space playground, where we've got all the mock ups and stuff like that. And, so a lot of our training will happen over there. Some of the galley stuff will happen over in building 5 so, where the simulators and the part task trainers are over there. And, then on the crew escaped side we actually get to have the fun, we go over to the Neutral Buoyancy Lab and we, you know, water survival and stuff. So, we get to go interface over there from time to time, as well.  Host: OK. You know what'd be a bad day, is training for both, training how to use the bathroom and then you have a bad day.  Mike Berrill: Yeah. Exactly.  Host: Yeah. My gosh. That's the worst. OK. So, let's talk about, just to add some context to what this means, because I'm imagine you guys -- I'm sure everyone's trying to imagine their own bathroom and how that works. It's just, the stuff goes in, you flush, and it goes bye, bye. What are the considerations when you're going to the bathroom in space?  Mike Berrill: Right. So, zero gravity, you know, you don't have gravity pulling your waste away from you. So that's the biggest challenge starting out. So, the toilets up in orbit they actually use airflow as the gravity equivalent. So, as you're urinating or, you know, pooing in space, right, we use airflow to help pull that waste away from you. So, it's kind of the thing. But, then again, you also have the challenge that you're in that microgravity situation. So, you kind of have to stabilize yourself where on the ground you can just kind of sit down or stand up next to it and it all works. It becomes exponentially more challenging when you only have two hands and you have to position yourself, make sure you're aiming correctly and everything like that. So, it becomes a little bit challenging.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: I'll add to that. The one thing that folks may not realize is that you can't do both urination and pooping in the same toilet.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: Oh, that's interesting.  Elisca Hicks: I'll let Mike explain that, because that's what he meant by you only have two hands, you're trying to position yourself.  Mike Berrill: Definitely, so.   Elisca Hicks: And, everything, so, Mike can explain.  Mike Berrill: Thank you for that. So yeah, your urine actually goes down what we call a urine receptacle on our system. Where it's basically just a hose that has that suction going through it. So, you would urinate into that. But we, and that's going to tie into our regenerative [Environmental Control and Life Support System] ECLSS where we reprocess that urine into water again. For the solid waste or, you know, pooing side of things, we kind of just have a can that has airflow going through it as well. And, then we just kind of collect that waste into baggies and then put it into this disposable can, we then seal it up nicely because you don't want those smells going anywhere.  Host: Yeah. So, it's almost like whenever you're going to the bathroom, one of the first things you have to think about, which is not something you have to think about on Earth, is almost like I got to turn the vacuum on first. I got to turn on the air first --  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: -- Before I use the bathroom.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely. We do have, you know, quite a few steps and we actually have some cue cards up there for crew members to kind of jog their memory. But, it's not as simple as just going in there and starting to use the system. They have to turn it on, make sure it's working properly before they can start using it.  Host: Oh, so it's a check and verify even before.  Elisca Hicks: Don't wait till the last minute.  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: You've got to give yourself a little bit of time, none of those last minute, “ah I got to go,” situations.  Host: Oh, so that's part of going to the bathroom in space is almost like planning your bowel movements, you have to give yourself some time --  Mike Berrill: Oh absolutely.  Host: To go through, like you said, you have to turn on the fan, you have to go through the check list, you have to verify that it's working.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: So, you're right, you can't just like, “oh man I got to go.” That's something that you really have to think about.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely. Especially since the crew member's time is so jam packed. Their days are scheduled for them to the minute kind of thing, you know.  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: So, they got to fit it in between activities in orbit. So, you know, they've got to.  Elisca Hicks: There's no potty breaks unfortunately.  Mike Berrill: You got to plan it out pretty well.  Host: Oh yeah. Because their schedule is experiment, experiment, experiment, and you know.  Elisca Hicks: Maybe a lunch break.  Host: Maybe, yeah.  Mike Berrill: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: And a lot of times they're working right through that too. So yeah, so it can get.  Mike Berrill: It gets fun.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: Very.  Host: So, what's the feedback you've gotten from crew about the way that it actually works in space that you implement your training?  Mike Berrill: Absolutely. So, you know, we can kind of understand the technical side of things. We explain how the system works to crew members. And, then we've actually been utilizing our debrief mechanism over here at JSC with crew members that have previously flown to kind of get feedback. So, “hey you took our training, how valuable was it to you? And, then what are your tips and tricks? Can you give us some, what was your experience in orbit and then how can we help train future astronauts based on your feedback?” And, so that really helps us out a lot. We've picked up lots of little tips and tricks over the years on how to make sure that our future crew members go up there prepared for the situation that they're going to be put in place. One of the other big things I guess, we kind of, we kind of alluded to with everything is that you know, we have these trainers and stuff like that. But, we have gravity here. Right? So, we have trainers that we can utilize. But, they won't ever get to fully experience this process of going to the bathroom until they get into orbit.  Elisca Hicks: There's a little learning curve.  Mike Berrill: Right. So, you know, we try our best, but.  Host: Yeah. OK. So, it's like they actually, you teach them about techniques, you teach them about the system and how that works. But, really, they put it all together for the first time in space.  Mike Berrill: Correct, yeah.  Host: And, that's when that really, that's the challenge, because you add that microgravity element.  Mike Berrill: It changes everything.  Host: Yeah. That's interesting because you're teaching a systems level thing, but you're also teaching like techniques and what works. Do you find that it's more individualized or do you find there's a universal technique?  Mike Berrill: We do get lots of feedback that's different for each crew member. There is, it's kind of a trend in this works well. And then some crew members kind of do things just a little bit differently. But, by and large, some of the techniques are pretty similar. You know, a lot of times we're lucky in that we have, you know, vehicles overlapping each other. So, the off going crew can kind of give their tips and tricks while they're on orbit, which gives them that quick memory jogger before they have to jump into it. Otherwise, you know, it could've been six months since they had me, you know, teaching these great potty techniques and they're just going to have to learn on the fly.  Host: That's true. They have a lot of other things they got to be learning at the same time.  Mike Berrill: You know, it's, with microgravity and fluids escaping, it becomes self-correcting pretty quickly, you figure it out.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, they do say they learn very quickly. We've had even some crew members say that it was just easier just to remove my pants completely.  Mike Berrill: Oh, yes.  Elisca Hicks: So, things like that even you'll get some comments.  Mike Berrill: Right. And, that's kind of what we were talking about with the you can't just go in there and expect to be ready to go. You have to, you know, the first couple of tries, they say I get fully unclothed to get this. I don't want to get any messes -- so.  Host: Yeah. I'm sure like the, one of the procedures is cleaning up afterwards too, just making sure that the bathroom itself is constantly clean.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: You've got a finite amount of people. And, these are, these systems have been running for a while now too.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: You have to keep them going.  Mike Berrill: Crew members get pretty close with each other. And, they understand, it's kind of just like, you know, living in an apartment with a friend or something like that. Right? You don't want to --  Elisca Hicks: Be courteous.  Mike Berrill: Yeah. Be courteous.  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: You don't want to leave a mess for your next, your next crew mate. And, they're really good about that, so.  Host: Now, I think some of our listeners might not know what the bathroom looks like or where it is on the space station. How I think it is, it's in a Node, it's in Node 3.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: It's in the same place with all the exercise equipment. Right?  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: But, you have, you have privacy. Right? There's like, there's barriers.  Mike Berrill: Yeah absolutely. So, you kind of equate it to kind of just like a public restroom where you have these stalls type thing. So, we actually have a stall up on orbit right now just to kind of preface all of that. We have two different toilets on orbit right now. There's a Russian one over on the Russian segment. And, then we have one, the Waste and Hygiene Compartment, also known as the WHC over in the U.S. segment in Node 3, like you mentioned. So right now, we have a stall that gives us that privacy. It's kind of cantilevered off of the front of the rack if you will, so it does have that above and below section kind of like you would in a regular stall.  Elisca Hicks: Just like at the regular bathroom.  Mike Berrill: Right. And, so it is a familiar feeling for them. But, they have that nice closed off privacy. And, like you mentioned, because it is in Node 3 where so many things go on, the exercise, you know, a lot of maintenance.  Elisca Hicks: Other hygiene.  Host: High traffic area.  Mike Berrill: Exactly.  Elisca Hicks It is.  Mike Berrill: The [Permanent Multipurpose Module] PMM, our big storage thing is right there. So, you've got people coming back and forward.  Elisca Hicks: The Cupola.  Mike Berrill: Yeah and Cupola, exactly. So, there's a lot of stuff going on there. So, privacy is a, you know, a big concern. But, our stall helps us with that.  Host: Yeah. You said the stall is kind of like a bathroom, so it's got an open top and an open bottom. So, to be courteous in space, I'm sure you take, you take around the closed barrier whenever you're going to the [Advanced Resistive Exercise Device] ARED or the exercise machine.  Mike Berrill: It is actually fully enclosed too, it has a door.  Host: Oh, the whole thing is enclosed.  Mike Berrill: It does have a top and bottom open.  Host: It's open, OK.  Mike Berrill: But there is a door on the front, which they can close, just like it would be for a stall here on the ground.  Host: Yeah, yeah. OK. I'm thinking about being courteous to your neighbors. Right? You don't want to be floating over the open.  Elisca Hicks: Oh no it's not that --  Mike Berrill: It's not that much.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah not much, I mean, you would have to really position yourself awkwardly --  Host: Interesting.  Elisca Hicks: --at the overhead to peak in. [Laughter]  Mike Berrill: I mean, you could be creepy, I guess. But, it's like eight inches or something. So, you'd have to be really trying so.  Host: Oh OK. OK. Well that's good. That's, it forces you to almost be courteous in space.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: So, this stall, right, I'm sure this is a nice private area for the crew and it's meant to be the bathroom. But, I think it's also where they shower. Right?  Elisca Hicks: So, that is a location.  Host: That is a location.  Elisca Hicks: But, we do have another location where crew have sort of created on their own at first. And, then we tried to help with that. So, in the PMM, there in bay one, they have a dedicated hygiene area as well. But, in order to protect the equipment and the stowage that's in there, we actually have what we call hygiene curtains. And, so these are covering, they are actually required to be there in order to protect the equipment. We don't want loose water flying out everywhere and then getting behind electronics or, you know, other stowage and then it gets moist and moldy. These are all kind of things that we have to think about. So, we try to protect that area. But, crew has a little bit of larger space than in the WHC, it is small.  Host: Oh, the stall is pretty small. So, this is sort of like the –  Elisca Hicks: How would you explain that, Mike?  Host: Storage closet PMM. It's kind of, it's kind of where things are stored.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: But you just have privacy, so, it's a little bit more space.  Mike Berrill: So, their big thing was is although you can go do the hygiene in the WHC area and that stall, would you really want to go, you know, take a shower where you're going to the bathroom? You know? It's not exactly something that you'd like to do. And, this, but the space is really constricting, as well.  Elisca Hicks: If you've lived on a sailboat, they --  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: A lot of those, right, you have your shower and your toilet in the same spot. I don't like that but.  Mike Berrill: No. If you want the closest comparison I can think of, go into an airplane bathroom and try and think about how you would do --  Elisca Hicks: How you would bathe.  Mike Berrill: How you would bathe in that small amount of space. But then also you have the toilet right there.  Mike Berrill: Would you even want to? Exactly.  Host: OK. So, this was the work around for the crew. The crew's like I need more space.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: So, OK where's a nice private area --  Mike Berrill: Yeah and crew, crew actually started it out. They said, hey, they wanted a little bit more room. And, so they actually came up with that idea themselves and then we kind of caught up with them.  Elisca Hicks: And, then we got it officially approved, yeah.  Mike Berrill: Yeah, we caught up with them and, you know, protected all the stuff to make sure that they had that space for them.  Host: OK. So, they have their, a little bit more space to shower, but it's not showering like you and I would.  Elisca Hicks: Oh no.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: No there's no flowing water at all.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: So, what happens is, essentially, you have a drink bag. So, the drink bag is made out of like a Mylar material. So, you use the portable water dispenser to fill up this drink bag, you know. But then you'll use that for your showering. We also have another bag that has, it's a shower gel kind of in it. And, then we also have another piece that is a towel inside that drink bag and it already has some soap already inside of that towel. So, you have a couple of different items you can use for your hygiene. You can just bring a bar of soap as well with your towels. So, you'd have to squirt the water out of the drink bag into your towel and wet that up. So, you're sponge bathing, essentially. But then how are you going to rinse? Right? So, then your kind of squirting the bottle, or the drink bag in little spots on your body. So, just to kind of give a visual here. So, it blobs up, so surface tension helps it stick to your body. So hopefully, if you're not shaking around a lot, it'll stick to your body and then you can use a towel to come and go over your entire body to rinse or dry off too.  Host: Oh OK.  Elisca Hicks: So, it's definitely different from on the ground.  Mike Berrill: Very.  Host: Wow.  Elisca Hicks: And, then washing your hair, of course, they have a technique for that as well to take that drink bag and kind of put some droplets of water on their scalp and then put little drops of shampoo. And, then they'll work it from their scalp moving upward up through their hair to kind of work it, the shampoo and the water, through their hair. So, they use actually really a small amount, like it's probably about 150 milliliters to 200 milliliters to bathe.  Host: That's it? Wow. Yeah, it makes you think man I'm wasting a lot of water in the shower.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: I'm just letting the thing run.  Mike Berrill: Very much so.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: And we don't have the luxury of wasting water up in orbit, so.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. Mike and I were actually talking the other day, I was trying to think of a good analogy. Kind of like, if you're in an RV, you know, you have a limited amount of water. And, so if you showered in that, or like on a sailboat. A lot of times people will turn on the water to just get wet, then lather up without the water running, and then turn the water on again to just rinse off. So, you want it really quick and short so that you can save your water. So, take that kind of as an analogy. But, you don't have the water running over you.  Mike Berrill: Yeah.  Host: Now, well that's an important thing. Right? Because this is not like the shower like you and I would have where like you, it's the, you know, you've got tiles on the walls and it's meant to go down a drain.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Host: You have to be conscious of where this water is going.  Elisca Hicks: Is going.  Host: And, it sounds like a lot of it's sticking to you. So that's good, but it sounds like you dry off with a towel. And, then what happens to this wet towel?  Elisca Hicks: Oh, that's a good one. So, the towel, you only get about one every five days. So, you do have to reuse your towels and be very cautious of what you're using them for. So, crew have actually come up with good techniques so, that towel that you're talking about goes up to hang, it gets hung up, floats there.  Host: Oh, yes.  Elisca Hicks: To air dray. So, and all that waste water again, goes back into the regeneration system, so that we can use it again for portable water. But, then those towels, crew will eventually downgrade them. So, they may use them for hygiene for a while. And, then after they kind of no longer that clean, then they'll start to use them as their exercise towels to help wipe off from sweaty stuff or if they need it to do any other type of cleaning, they'll just. They keep degrading it until, oh OK this, it's got to go in the trash.  Mike Berrill: That's where it needs to go.  Host: Yeah, that's what you mean by downgrading. I do the same thing, when I have old towels.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: And I've put them through the wash way too many times.  Elisca Hicks: Use them for your housekeeping.  Host: Yeah, they become like car towels.  Mike Berrill: Right. Exactly.  Host: OK. So that's what you mean, it's like eventually, you go from a bathing towel to now it's wiping down equipment.  Elisca Hicks: Exactly.  Host: This thing is, yeah, it's been used too much.  Elisca Hicks: Too much.  Host: OK. So, you're really, I mean efficiency seems to be a really key theme here.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: Like you're using the same towel over and over again, but you're still thinking about the life cycle of that towel because you only have a limited number of towels.  Elisca Hicks: You only get so many.  Host: Yeah. You can't just go down to Walmart and get more.  Elisca Hicks: Nope.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: And, it cost a whole lot to send up more stuff.  Mike Berrill: It does, yeah.  Host: Oh, OK. So, this is part of the feedback that the crew has given you on shower as to implement to have more space. Do you get more preference? It sounds like there's a lot of options too when it comes to showering, you know, you can use this water droplet technique you can use the soap impregnated towel technique, you can use all these. So, what are, what kinds of tips and tricks are the crew giving you to implement into shower, showering and hygiene?  Elisca Hicks: Well, Mike help me if you think of any in particular.  Mike Berrill: I'm trying to think of our debriefs, right. A lot of them they kind of, they all have their own techniques and their own preferences. Not everyone uses all the different types.  Elisca Hicks: Correct.  Mike Berrill: Some of them have their preference.  Elisca Hicks: They have to pick, actually, ahead of time. So, there's a whole other group called crew provisions. And, they get to go pick out their clothes that they want and what type of shampoo, what kind of toothpaste they want.  Host: Oh interesting.  Elisca Hicks: And so, but yeah, if you want a bar of soap, then you need to decide that before you even fly. So, we've had some situations where people end up not liking what they picked. And, then luckily another crew member had something. And, so they'll try to take that information and pass it along to other crew members just to be aware of.  Mike Berrill: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, other options.  Mike Berrill: I guess one of the good examples I can think of is something, again, you wouldn't really think about because we take it for granted, is hot showers. Right? Well we don't have, you know, running water. So, how would they do that? Actually, one of the things we found out is crew members they would take their drink bags or their, you know, soapy water bags and actually put it in the food warmer to warm it up. Right? So, then they'd come back about 30 minutes later and have a warm shower.  Elisca Hicks: Well, we have hot water but --  Host: A warm shower.  Mike Berrill: And, it's just something you wouldn't even have thought about. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: It just, ambient is what we usually use on orbit.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: So, they warm it up for themselves if they want that warm shower feeling, and they can take their shower like that. So again, things we take for granted here on the ground.  Elisca Hicks: Even the preparation, like you said, like --  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: You can dispense hot water out of the Portable Water Dispenser. But if, let's say you had other things to go do and you're gathering your other stuff. Well it might get cold by the time you can go to that. So, you're sticking it in the food warmer till it is time to go take your bath.  Host: Oh wow. And, what's interesting, I think an interesting thing here is that crew preference is throughout this whole thing. Whether you want a bar of soap, whether you want the gel, whether you want -- you have options, that's the weird thing to me when it comes to spaceflight. Usually, like, when you think about that, you think about astronauts with like protein bars, this is what you're getting. You're getting this soap and that's it. But, it's interesting, there's a little bit of preference here.  Elisca Hicks: So, there is a little bit. They definitely have to be careful about what they pick. And, if you want a certain thing that, they have to look at all the ingredients because of that ECLSS system that we talked about. Some of our systems can't handle like alcohol for example. So, if you want a particular type of lotion and it has a high alcohol content, they're not, they're not going to allow you to fly that. So, there are, there is a set number of options.  Host: Approved list.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. There's an approved list. And, if you really wanted to go outside of that list, it has to get special permission to look at the contents of it. Can we, you know, can we handle those ingredients? Because it's an enclosed loop system for sure.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: Everything you eat, you know, you drink, you breathe, it's all getting recycled.  Host: Yeah. You have to be conscious of this, you have to be conscious of the crew preference, yes, and making sure that they feel like almost at home, because they're going to be up there for a long time.  Elisca Hicks: The moral.  Mike Berrill: It's is a moral thing as well. So, if we can get them as close to what they're used to on the ground, it does help out.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: It’s Nice.  Elisca Hicks: But then also considering the systems. Like these systems have to run and they, you can't mess up the water recycling, because that is your source of water.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: Yeah. All right. I'm going through my house now.  Elisca Hicks: OK.  Host: We've done the bathroom, we've done the shower. I'm moving on to brushing your teeth.  Elisca Hicks: OK.  Host: So, what's it like to brush your teeth in space?  Elisca Hicks: The brushing your teeth, you don't have a sink to sit in, spit in, so you have to just either spit it out in a towel. And, again, one of those things, you're going to just hang it up to dry, your spit will get reclaimed and then. Or, you know, if you have a small amount of toothpaste, you could swallow it if you absolutely wanted to, but that's, that could be, yeah you don't want to do that too much. Spitting in the towel is usually the way that they'll do it.  Host: And, is this, do they go in that little PMM section to do that or can you do this in your crew quarters?  Mike Berrill: Yeah, they can, they can do it.  Elisca Hicks: Crew quarters.  Mike Berrill: Yeah, they can do it wherever they feel is the best place. Actually, right now, on the side of that stall, where the WHC lives, on the outside of that, they actually have this kind of personal hygiene corner where they've got these, they've got these little comfort kits, where they've got a lot of their personal hygiene products in it where they brush their teeth, they shave, they have a mirror. And, they'll go do it there all in that one nice location.  Elisca Hicks: Because if someone's in the, I'll call it the shower, if they're in the PMM, then, you might want to be brushing your teeth, you know, you've got those separate areas as well, so.  Host: Oh OK. Yeah, we're thinking about the whole crew here. Someone's going to be showering, someone's going to be brushing their teeth, leaving the toilet open, so you're not --  Elisca Hicks: Exactly.  Host: OK, OK.  Elisca Hicks: You've got a lot of crew. Like we, right, we just had four U.S. crew members up there so, with one toilet.  Mike Berrill: Exactly.  Elisca Hicks: It takes a little coordination.  Host: That's right.  Mike Berrill: Got to rotate around a little bit.  Elisca Hicks: Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Host: Are they using basic toothbrushes, or are we doing --  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: -- Electric toothbrushes.  Elisca Hicks: No. No electric toothbrushes.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: They do have just normal toothbrushes, but they get one every 21 days is the resupply for the toothbrush. So, you know, because you can't really rinse it out very well or anything. So, you're going to use it and then you'll get another one later.  Host: Oh OK. And, that's it. That one's pretty simple. Right? You just have a space to brush your teeth, you spit it in the towel, and then make sure that, that water gets recycled.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: OK. All right. Let's see what else? You said, oh you mentioned they had this little space where you can brush your teeth and they talk, you said a little bit about shaving.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: Right yeah shaving as well. You know, I don't want to step on Elisca, but they do, you know, they have, they do, the crew members that need to shave, they have options. They'll have like an electric razor as an option. Again, this is all kind of managing crew.  Elisca Hicks: Crew preference again, yeah.  Mike Berrill: The crew preference. Or they can also use like just general safety razors that we use, you know.  Elisca Hicks: Just manual, every day.  Mike Berrill: Safety razor. And, they'll get a supply of either shaving gel or cream and they can just go ahead and shave themselves. Again, same thing, no running water so you kind of have to use a towel, again, going back to what Elisca mentioned, maybe it's a downgraded hygiene towel now that they can just wipe all the stuff off that you wouldn't want to wipe back on yourself. Right? So, and then the other big thing is, you know, especially if you're using an electric razor. If you guys have ever used an electric razor and if you've ever opened up to the top of that, just little hairs everywhere. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: So that could become like an explosion of little hairs. And, you know, you don't want to get that in your eye or anything like that. So actually, this personal hygiene area has some vents right next to it. So, if anything does get liberated, it actually turns toward that vent away from our crew members as well.  Elisca Hicks: And, then they can go back and clean it later on, which we'll talk more later about housekeeping.  Mike Berrill: Housekeeping  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. So, the razors, the manual razors, they actually don't reuse those, those, because you can't clean them out very well, they get a new razor every day.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: Or blade I should say.  Host: And, you don't really want a dull blade in space either so yeah.  Mike Berrill: No.  Host: To change those out would be pretty important. Are you using, you had this technique, it's hard to visualize on the podcast with an audio thing, you had this technique where you were pretending to hold the razor and you were dipping, you were dipping the razor blade in, I think what was a towel?  Elisca Hicks: Actually, you're going to wipe it.  Host: You're wiping it.  Elisca Hicks: Wipe it onto the towel.  Mike Berrill: Kind of across the blade swiping.  Elisca Hicks: So that you can at least get the hair and the shaving cream off of the razor blade to go back and reapply it to your face or your legs.  Host: Is this a, is this a water free sort of technique? Or are you just using shaving cream and blade and just that's it?  Mike Berrill: The cream itself is usually, it's good.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: I'm sure again, every crew member might be a little bit different, right, and want to use a little bit of water as well.   Host: They might do the little dab technique.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: Like they do for the shower.  Elisca Hicks: Maybe the dab technique. I know some of our other crew members that don't have any hair on their head, that they will just use the lotion and, you know, they like that a lot too, just go right over their head --  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: -- with the razor. So, but yeah, so it's like again --  Mike Berrill: Preference.  Elisca Hicks: Preference yeah.  Host: Crew preference, yeah, there's a lot of that. Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: And what works best. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: You do it one time and you're like, no need a little water.  Mike Berrill: Yeah definitely.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, so.  Host: So, you talked about this, you talked about this, I'm focusing on this area where you can brush your teeth, where you can shave and stuff. You talked about there's vents that seems like a good place to capture like nails and stuff too if you're clipping your nails.  Elisca Hicks: So, we have, we actually have special fingernail clippers that have a little container on them that try to capture it. And, they do send up fingernail clippers and toenail clippers. But, exactly, if you get one that goes loose, rogue on you. So, you want to do that near this [High Efficiency Particulate Air] HEPA filter so that it gets sucked onto that filter and then later on, you can go back and clean it up with a vacuum cleaner. But yeah. It's important, because you don't want one of those in your eyeball.  Host: No.  Mike Berrill: No.  Elisca Hicks: Or accidentally sucked it up in your mouth.  Host: Yeah so, it's kind of like home because, you know, if I'm shaving I do it over the sink.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Host: You know? I'm not just going to be doing it in like a random room, there's like a place that I'm doing it. And, it's like it's the same as space station, you just have a place and it is next to that vent.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: That vent is super important, especially for those rogue hairs. I can see that thing.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: Especially for the eyes, and something for, yeah. Oh, haircuts too.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: Is this the place where you do haircuts?  Elisca Hicks: Yes, it is.  Mike Berrill: It can be, it can be a location.  Elisca Hicks: Yes, we have a couple of different locations. So, in the Nodes, so Node 1 and Node 2 and 3 there are vents that we usually suggest. But there are some exceptions to that, because Node 1 is where you're doing most of your eating, that's where our whole galley rack is located. So, you kind of want to think about that too, like, “do I want to clip my toenails and cut my hair where I'm going to be eating?” Maybe not. So yeah. So, Node 3 usually around the WHC area, you know, it's already got that and the exercise equipment, so. And, it has good airflow on those vents. So, but for hair cutting, we actually need to assist because the vent is not quite enough suction while you're doing your hair cutting. So, you have a vacuum cleaner. And, we have an attachment called the hair clipper hose. And, we'll use that. And, we have the hair clipper, like a barber hair clipper. But, we also have regular grade salon scissors. And so, we've had some crew members actually take their fellow crew members to their hairdressers and had one ask me.  Mike Berrill: This is how I prefer.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, I know. It was kind of cool, one day, I had one ask me, “where do you get your hair cut Elisca?” And I told her and she's like, “OK great.” The next thing I know, our hairdresser's telling me that they brought in her fellow crew member and she taught, the hair dresser, taught the other crew member how to cut her hair. And so.  Host: Wow.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. So that you can kind of keep up your stylish. Right? It's still floating everywhere. So, but if you like short hair or you know.  Mike Berrill: You got to add that to the astronaut's job descriptions, hair cutting skills.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: Hairdresser. [Laughter]  Host: They really are everything. They're the scientist, they're the mechanic, they're the plumber and they're the barber.  Elisca Hicks: They do.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Elisca Hicks: Yes. So that hair clipper hose, helps, it's kind of a two-person job as well. So, one will be cutting someone's hair and the other one's got that hair clipper hose kind of close to their head to catch those loose hairs as they're getting cut off and then goes into the vacuum cleaner.  Host: OK. So there really is a little bit of styling. You know, you're, a lot of this job is, yes, hygiene and making sure that the place is clean and making sure that the astronauts are taken care of. But there is, there's a lot of personal elements more so, than I actually realized of, to just try to make it like home.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: And, that includes having a hairstyle that you're comfortable with.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: That you feel good with.  Mike Berrill: And, I mean it's moral, but it's also, you know, they're doing, you know, PAO events all the time, they're getting, you know, videos down linked. So, you know, they want to look good for the camera.  Host: Yeah. That's true. Is there, is there a cosmetic, more cosmetic elements to this? Like is there, you know, are we talking hair and makeup?  Elisca Hicks: So again, it goes down to that crew provisions and you can request particular makeup.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: But again, it has to make sure that it passes those ingredients and make sure that we can actually bring that up on space station. So again, approves list, but if you have something special you can, got to go through all the, yeah, you may not be able to bring what you normally have so.  Host: Oh OK.  Elisca Hicks: But, yeah, it again, that's up to the crew if they want to bring makeup or not.  Host: And, making sure that it's, I guess good for space too. Right?  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: You don't want to have liquids flying everywhere, you've got to have a bottle that works.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Host: And all these, all these different space considerations. OK. So, I'm going through my house again. Right? We're talking about shaving, I'm going out, I'm going out of the bathroom now and I'm going over to my laundry room. I have a lot of laundry to do for sure. And, I mean, honestly, like maybe two times I'll wear a shirt, but then it's going right in, right in the wash. That's kind of me. What is it like in space?  Elisca Hicks: For space, they have their daily wear, they also get exercise clothing and sleepwear. But, they definitely do not get to change it every day. Your shirt, your daily shirt is one every seven days. Underwear's every one to two days, I mean two to three days for underwear, you're going to re-wear it. And then your exercise clothes, again, usually one every five days, and you're just hanging that up to dry when it's all sweaty and you get that reclaimed and you're going to re-wear it. But again, space or stowage, I want to be careful with the word I use. Stowage is --  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: -- a very complicated thing on a space station. You do not have a lot of space.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: So, we really have to be mindful of that. So, your towel, like we mentioned, your towel you get one and you have to reuse them. So, same thing with your clothes. And, there is no washing machine.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: So, you, after you can't use it anymore, you're going to be throwing it away.  Host: Wow. OK. So, you use it as much as you can until it's no longer hygienic to wear and then it's going in the trash.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, your crew member makes a funny look at you going, I think it's time. [Laughter]  Mike Berrill: Yeah exactly. Those rates sound really high. Right? But remember, you know, the ISS is a very controlled environment. Right? So, we don't have the high swings, highs and lows like we do here on the ground, so.  Elisca Hicks: Right. Thank you, Mike.  Mike Berrill: You know, just the day to day wear, probably not going to be overly sweating into it. Right? But --  Elisca Hicks: Your temperature and humidity is the same.  Mike Berrill: Exactly.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, it's very controlled, the temperature and humidity.  Host: So, the environment is important to the hygienic aspect of things too.  Mike Berrill: Definitely.  Host: So, you're not sweating through your clothes all the time.  Mike Berrill: Right. And, so obviously exercise they are going to be sweating. Right?  Elisca Hicks: You're not going outside, you don't get that weird outside smell and then go inside.  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: Because I remember the first time I heard one ever seven days for a shirt, I'm like wow, that's a lot.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: But you know, it's so heavily, you know, managed, the environment up there, it's actually not quite as bad.  Host: Yeah. It seems like there's a little bit of personalization when it comes to laundry too, or when it comes to just clothing that you wear. I see T-shirts from alma maters and that sort of thing.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: Yeah.  Host: But it seems like there's just like space pants. Am I right in saying that? There's just space pants.  Elisca Hicks: There are some that, yeah.  Host: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: A lot of different options.  Host: The ones with the Velcro on it.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Mike Berrill: So, exactly, you got to really think about it. So, you know, pants with Velcro are just like gold on orbit so.  Host: Yeah. Yeah. So, it's, that practicality there because you want to stick, you're working all day, so you want something that sticks, you want maybe a moisture wicking fabric, I don't know if it is moisture wicking or not. But, it's just something you know is going to be compact and something that's practical and something that will last for a week. You know?  Elisca Hicks: Or more. The pants, I'm looking at my sheet here to make sure. One every 30 days for your pants. Host: No way.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. And, so we've had, I've heard some stories about, you know, you go to eat something, and it gets away from you and it ends up on your pants. And now what? And, so you're trying to clean them off.  Host: You can’t have this stain for 25 days.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: I have a PAO event in a little while. [Laughter]  Mike Berrill: I got to go change my pants for this PAO event, sorry guys. [Laughter]  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. So again, you really have to be conscious of how you're using your clothes.  Host: Every 30 days, I'm trying to do that like a little bit of math. On a typical six month increments that's six pairs of pants that you're wearing for the, for your whole mission. Wow, that's not a lot.  Mike Berrill: No, that's not.  Elisca Hicks: No.  Host: Six pairs of pants a week maybe.  Mike Berrill: Yeah exactly.  Elisca Hicks: Hope they fit, right. Don't gain too much weight. [Laughter]  Mike Berrill: Exactly. And, not to get into that much, but their physiology does change while they're in orbit. You know? So.  Host: Yeah, spine elongation.  Mike Berrill: Spine elongation.  Elisca Hicks: Some people lose weight; some people can maintain it if they're exercising and eating enough calories. So yeah that's all.  Host: Yeah. So now I'm leaving the laundry room, I'm going downstairs to the kitchen. I just had a wonderful meal. I have silverware. Do they have silverware up in space?  Elisca Hicks: They do have silverware.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: So, they have metal silverware that they'll clean off and then reuse. So, if you've ever seen, in Node 1, a photo of the galley area, you'll see they actually just have labels and then they've got them like stuck to the outside of the rack, tapped up there or Velcroed up there. So, they use their silverware. They get a knife, they get a fork, a spoon, a really long spoon, and yeah.  Host: They just, one set per crew member?  Elisca Hicks: One set per crew member.  Host: No way. What do they wash it with?  Elisca Hicks: So, we have, we were talking about this the other day. So, I'll be, I'll be just, because we're talking very casually we've heard some people just lick it an go on.  Host: Hey it's your fork.  Elisca Hicks: It's your fork exactly. That's what I was saying, just make sure you don't use someone else's.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: Or, but the other thing you can do is we have disinfectant wipes onboard. They'll wipe that and then just so that residue's not left on there, they'll take a towel with some water and wipe that off again and then just hang it out to dry.  Host: Is that it for dishes? Because I think, the food comes in packages and stuff, so yeah.  Mike Berrill: Yeah, it's all self-packaged.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Host: Yeah you don't have plates or anything you have to worry about.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Host: So, it's really just the silverware and then you just have your set.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. So.  Host: And it's up to you to maintain it however you want.  Elisca Hicks: Right. You have a set that you go up on your vehicle with.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: And, then in what's called your crew preference food container, I'll call it, they actually have their specific set. So, I guess technically you have two.  Mike Berrill: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: But, you have to hold on to the one that you flew up with until you can find--  Mike Berrill: Exactly.  Elisca Hicks: -- That.  Mike Berrill: Yeah, your main set.  Elisca Hicks: The container that's got your silverware in it.  Mike Berrill: Exactly. Your main set will already be onboard before you arrive.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Mike Berrill: And, so you fly up on a vehicle, that vehicle will have a temporary set for you to use until you find your --  Elisca Hicks: Your set, yeah exactly.  Mike Berrill: Your utensils, right.   Host: Yeah you get like the plastic fork until you find, until you find, yeah. Oh man. You have more of an incentive to go find your silverware. Right?  Mike Berrill: Exactly.  Host: Oh, that's interesting. So, what about, so you talked about disinfectant wipes. That makes me think about like washing your hands.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: Like one of the top things that doctors say if you want to prevent diseases like the number one thing you can do is wash your hands. How do they wash their hands?  Elisca Hicks: So, we have several different types of wipes onboard. So, I’ll be careful about the disinfectant wipe is really more for cleaning, house cleaning and things. And, it does have a hydrogen peroxide as the cleaning agent. So, if you've ever used that on your skin a lot, it could dry out your skin. So, we do have wet wipes, like a baby wipe onboard as well. And, I've even heard some people using that pouch with the soap, they'll just kind of get a little bit of that and wash their hands real quick. So, it's really again, I hate to say, crew preference again. But it is, it is.  Mike Berrill: Whatever works.  Elisca Hicks: You know, so yeah, if you're going to use a wet wipe to try to clean off your hands.  Host: Now I know like --  Elisca Hicks: Because we've got those easily throughout the station as well. Like so they'll just have wet wipes attached to the outside of the rack in various locations in station.  Host: Yeah. I know just washing your hands is just a normal thing that we do here, because there's just, there's disease and there's --  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: You know, it's just a normal thing just to stay hygienic. But, the space station is just a controlled environment. Like is it the same, is it the same thing washing your hands, preventing diseases? Or is it, you know, you don't have to worry about that as much maybe, or maybe there is bacteria.  Mike Berrill: A little bit of both.  Elisca Hicks: There is. So, we've had, in the past, we've had some microbial growth, I'll say.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: I'll call it. So, we, and again, if you're not cleaning up after yourself, we are humans, we are gross. If you've ever watched some of the YouTube videos, Don Pettit has a great one about skin falling off, the bottom of your feet.  Host: Oh, I seen that one.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: He shines a light and he pulls off his sock, right.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, he said you have to change your socks by a filter, that same filter we were talking about to catch your toenails and your hair and everything.  Host: Yes.  Elisca Hicks: So yeah, your skin cells and everything.  Mike Berrill: That video definitely enlightened me.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah hygiene.  Mike Berrill: So, you know. Our skin comes off us all the time, but it just falls to the ground.  Elisca Hicks: Falls to the ground.  Mike Berrill: That doesn't happen in space --  Elisca Hicks: We don't really think about that --  Host: Right.  Elisca Hicks: -- going everywhere and in weird places behind racks and inside of vent tubes and you know. So, they have, they have weekly housekeeping. I don’t know, am I jumping too far ahead? [Laughter]  Host: No, that was exactly where I was going next, because that was where my brain was going. Like, they got, I want to wipe that stuff down.  Elisca Hicks: Exactly.  Host: I'm thinking about it, yeah.  Elisca Hicks: So, we do have housekeeping scheduled for the crew every weekend. So, kind of like you, at your house. Right? You got to do it. No one wants to really do it. But, you have to.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: And so, on the weekends they get time scheduled to do housekeeping. That includes vacuuming all the vents, wiping down hard surfaces, the walls, the ceilings, everything, and just anything that needs some special attention. Obviously, our dirtier modules would be Node 3, because we do have the WHC, all of the exercise equipment and everything in there. So, we actually list the modules in preference for the crew members. So like Node 3's your dirtiest then maybe Node 1, because that's where you're eating, and everything. So, kind of just like your house, your bathroom, probably is really important to clean.  Mike Berrill: Yeah.  Host: Yep.  Elisca Hicks: And your kitchen. And, then you can kind of, you know, go around and get those other areas. But --  Mike Berrill: And, you know, every crew member's a little bit differently. We do know that crew members will clean up as they go during the week as well. We just schedule a little bit of time on the weekend.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Mike Berrill: To make sure they have the time needed, if needed.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah.  Host: So, it sounds like using those wipes and it sounds like a lot of vacuuming too.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: There is a lot of vacuuming. [Laughter]  Host: Yeah. So, like I have a vacuum that I plug into the wall and then I roll around the house. How does the vacuum work in space?  Elisca Hicks: So, we have a commercial grade vacuum cleaner. And, they just like, well the one thing to think about, so nowadays there's bunch of vacuum cleaners out there that have just the canisters and you just dump it into your trash can, right, your dirt. And, we can't do that on orbit. So, we still have the vacuum cleaners that have the debris bags inside of them. So, for the young folks out there, go look this up. There is a debris bag that goes inside of the vacuum cleaner and then you have to change that out. And, so we've actually gotten some techniques from some crew to actually leave the vacuum cleaner on. So, they'll lift the lid where the debris bag is, but they'll leave the vacuum cleaner on because that bag is full of stuff. Right? You don't want that coming back out at you.  Host: Oh yeah.  Elisca Hicks: So, we've, from feedback from crew, we've built a procedure where they have to leave the vacuum cleaner running. Then, they place a piece of tape over that hole so that nothing comes out at them. And, then they can take out that debris bag and then stick it in the trash for later where they're stowing all their trash and put in a new debris back and ready to go, keep vacuuming.  Host: Yeah. Like a disposable technique, but you got to keep that, you got to keep all the stuff sucked into the bag. And, taping it, that's an interesting.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah, that's not a nice day when you get a mouthful of dust and whatever else.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure especially with some of the newcomers. They have to learn this from scratch or rely a lot on their crew mates for learning some of these --  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Host: -- Interesting techniques like.  Elisca Hicks: Again the --  Host: Who would've thought to tape down a vacuum bag?  Elisca Hicks: Right, but again, in training, we --  Mike Berrill: That's one of the things we hit heavily is --  Elisca Hicks: We hit that one hard.  Host: Really?  Mike Berrill: If you don't do it right, it's going to be messy.  Elisca Hicks: It's going to be, yeah, you'll learn real quick if you don't. Right?  Mike Berrill: Self-correcting.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah so, we have that commercial grade one. We also have a wet dry one which is custom made by NASA. And, so we've got that for in the weird circumstance that we do have a liquid spill, that we do have something that can suck up liquids too, so.  Host: All right. Yeah, now that kind of leads into my next thought which is a lot of these systems. Right? We talk about just basic hygiene. I'm walking myself through the house, I'm thinking about all these different things. But like, when you're training for actually using the systems, I'm sure the vacuum is just something you plug in and just go around. But, even just maintaining the International Space Station as a system. You have filters, right, that are changed. We talked about going near this hygiene space where there's hair, theirs nails and stuff. How do you, how do you clean that?  Elisca Hicks: So again, with the vacuum cleaner.  Host: With the vacuum.  Elisca Hicks: Yep.  Host: OK.  Elisca Hicks: You will go back over it and suck it out. And, the actual people who own the actual filters, they have a routine scheduled deep cleaning of those areas too. But on the weekends, you're hitting it, kind of like your air conditioner vent at home. Do you know what I'm talking about?  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Elisca Hicks: The filters, same thing. You're just going to go around and take your vacuum cleaner.  Mike Berrill: Just surface cleaning.  Elisca Hicks: Yep.  Mike Berrill: Every week and then just like a deep clean every so much amount of time.  Elisca Hicks: Right.  Host: Got it. OK.  Elisca Hicks: Right. So, you're just hitting it with the vacuum cleaner and then going on to the next one.  Host: All right. Now, I know, speaking of systems, one of the most important one I think is the bathroom.  Elisca Hicks: It is.  Host: That bathroom is so important. So, just training for using that system, the system level parts of things, what are you, what are you training the crew to do?  Mike Berrill: Right. So, this is something they're going to use multiple times a day every single day.  Host: Right.  Mike Berrill: So, we really have to get them comfortable with the system. I kind of alluded to it earlier. You know, we teach them a little bit of everything. First, we have a nice flow of classes for them to take, you know, so they can get first introduced to. “Hey what is, kind of like what we're doing right now, what is the bathroom on orbit? How do you use it and how's it going to be different for you?” Right. Then we go into a more specific type class, where we talk about this is now how you're going to use it, and this is how it functions. Right? So, we go into a little bit more of an engineering detail to kind of say this is how it works. Some things that we use is that there's a separator inside of this thing, so that when the liquid goes in, right, it's coming in with air and liquid. But, we want to reclaim that water. So, there's actually like a spinning drum on the inside that actually pulls the water to the outside of that drum and allows the air to continue going through the center. And then we can siphon off that water, essentially, so that it can go into to our regenerative ECLSS systems.  Host: OK. So, this is not, you're talking about a toilet that's been connected to the water recycling water.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely, our toilet is, our toilet is directly plumed into our recycling stuff. So that, you know, exactly, as soon as we urinate into the system, we can start, you know, getting the process going for recycling, if we needed to.  Host: I'm sure just as important as learning to use these systems is learning how to fix these systems.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely. Right. So.  Elisca Hicks: That's a big one.  Mike Berrill: Think about it, you know, if you are in one of those houses that only has one bathroom and you know, a lot of people. Right? We have four USOS crew members with one USOS bathroom. Right? If that bathroom goes down, yes, we do have the Russian's one, we each have a handshake we can use in those types of situations. But, crew members are very motivated to get that bathroom up and running again. Right? You don't want to have to go next door and use their bathroom if you don't have to. Right?  Host:  Drop everything and fix the toilet.  Mike Berrill: Yeah. So, you know we do, our group specifically is very lucky in that crew time opens up very quickly when the bathroom breaks. They're very motivated to get it fixed. But yes, no, it is a mechanical piece of hardware like everything else on the ground or up in orbit, you know, it does tend to break. However, you know, we do, you know, we're very cognizant of maintenance cycles, as well. So, we'll preemptively replace things so that we don't have it break in really important times, as well.  Host: Oh OK. So, not only fixing when it breaks, but you're talking about a maintenance routine.  Mike Berrill: Yeah, a maintenance schedule. So, we do some preventative stuff too. So instead of waiting for this piece of hardware to fail, we will preemptively take it out and replace it so that it doesn't fail when you don't want it to.  Host: OK. Yeah. I'm sure we've learned a lot about this bathroom system and how it works and breaking. And, that's a huge consideration going forward too, right, is just the bathroom and the reliability of that bathroom. Are we looking at just how this system works, and looking forward to the next things and next systems?  Mike Berrill: Yeah exactly. And, so one of the things that's coming soon, I'll say, is there's, we have already developed a future toilet for the Orion program. That is actually going to be flown up onto the International Space Station soon in the next year or so. And, that's going to be flown up there early to do kind of like a technology demonstration to prove a concept essentially. You were kind of talking about reliability. The scope of the mission changes for these types of missions. For Orion, the Moon, Mars, and stuff like that. You know, we're further away from Earth, our back and forth communication gets a little bit more delayed and stuff like that. So, you know, we want it to be reliable so that it doesn't break as often. How do we do that? You know, it could be less mechanical parts, maybe a little more simple design, stuff like that. But, it may also need to make it a little bit more robust as well. So, like I mentioned, we are flying that new toilet here pretty soon. It's going to be approved up on the space station ready to fly when Orion launches in the next few years, so.  Host: All right. Yeah that's an important one. That's very exciting too.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: And, then there's a lot to be learned on the space station because we've done it for so long that you can start thinking about those things and start thinking about reliability.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: And that next generation, that's really --  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: So, one of the things I forgot actually was, this is an important part of hygiene, is, you know, I was going through my house again, taking out the trash, you know.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Host: We talked about laundry's part of that trash. Seems like you're sucking up a lot of things with this vacuum and using the disposal bags, that's got to build up quickly. So, what's, where's it going, how's it stored?  Mike Berrill: Exactly.  Elisca Hicks: Poop containers.  Mike Berrill: Yeah exactly.  Host: That's a big one.  Mike Berrill: So yeah, we've got a couple of different trash. I'll kind of focus on both. Right? So, you've got your day to day trash. Maybe your old food containers, you know, you vacuum, your nails, your hair, whatever the case may be. What we have to think about is, you know, we've got a nice trash service here on the ground where you can go put your trash on the curb and it magically goes away. Right? You know, that is not an option on orbit. So, we have to use our resupply vehicles efficiently. Right? So, some of our resupply vehicles, they can come back to Earth and bring back stuff for them, the others actually kind of do that destructive reentry. Right? So, what we end up doing for that is, we put all of our trash onto those vehicles. And, when they do reenter the Earth's atmosphere and break up, our trash breaks up with it. Right? It all just goes back to the Earth.  Elisca Hicks: But you are living with your trash.  Mike Berrill: Yep.  Elisca Hicks: So, as we were describing in the PMM about your hygiene area and I said it was in the first bay at the back end of that module is your dumpsters.  Mike Berrill: It's usually where a lot of our trash is.  Elisca Hicks: That is where a lot of our trash is stowed.  Host: Oh wow.  Elisca Hicks: And, Mike started to explain that we have different types of trash though. We do have wet trash area and you want to keep that separate, because of again those microbial issues and things.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: You don't want stuff growing and getting out or whatever. So, we put those in a special type of bag that helps seal it a little bit better, helps with smells, those kinds of things. So, we even have different types of trash bags.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Elisca Hicks: Depending on what the trash is.  Host: See that's got to be important if you're storing your trash for a long period of time, the microbial growth yes, but that that smell.  Mike Berrill: Absolutely.  Host: Just maintaining that. And, I guess tucking it in the back of that module.  Mike Berrill: Yes.  Host: And putting it in a special container, that's --  Mike Berrill: That's the best you can get.  Elisca Hicks: Yes, I was about to say, I'm sure we don't love it, but.  Mike Berrill: Not every bag is the same. Right? And so, some of them, you know, get a little bit leaky. And we just try to double the bag or triple the bag to try and help out. You know, like I said, it' not weekly. Those vehicles only come down at certain intervals. So, you're stuck with it until you can get rid of it.  Elisca Hicks: Until you can get rid of it.  Host: Wow. And, that's, so you said stowage is a big thing. Right? Because I'm thinking about, I'm focusing in on the clothes, for a second, because you have finite amount of clothes. So, you have clothes that are bringing up, so you have all of these. Here's what you have prepared for you, for your expedition, for your next six months. But, then you also have to think about that turning into trash.  Mike Berrill: Yes.  Host: So, you're constantly thinking about what's going up, but also what you have to throw away.  Mike Berrill: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: Exactly. And your whole groups.  Mike Berrill: Yeah, our group doesn't manage that.  Host: OK.  Mike Berrill: But they are very intent on, you know, what goes up and what goes down so.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. And it, I mean, because even again, if you have to think about it, because it's going on a vehicle and it's reentering, you want to make sure that, that center of mass is properly figured out. So, there's whole groups that want to know, not just, “oh this water bottle, how much does it weigh? How much space does it take up? Where do we need to put it? And, if it fits in with this other trash. And then where on the vehicle do we need to put it for the whole mass center?” Yeah.  Host: Wow.  Elisca Hicks: It gets complicated. So.  Host: See, this but -- doing this constantly on the International Space Station has to have informed a lot of how to live in space.  Mike Berrill: Oh absolutely.  Host: There's so much to think about.  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: Just brushing your teeth. Where does the toothpaste go?  Elisca Hicks: Yes.  Host: What about vacuuming? What can we, what have we learned? What are the primary things that we're gathering right now so that we can get ready for Artemis and start doing this on the Moon when it comes to reliability when it comes to this is what's required for Artemis mission?  Mike Berrill: Right. So, you know we've got a lot of great programs coming up with Artemis and the Moon and future and Mars. And, so the ISS has been a great way to prove all of these technologies and our processes to make sure that we're ready for those types of things. Because, like I mentioned, you know, these other programs are going further and further away. So, we need to make sure they work well, efficiently, and so that we're successful in those future missions.  Elisca Hicks: Yeah. Lots of discussions currently happening. We don't have exact answers.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: For you probably right now, today.  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: But, yeah, definitely needs to be reliable and yeah. What are you going to do with your trash? Right?  Host: Yeah.  Elisca Hicks: So those are discussions that are currently in the works right now.  Host: Wow. So much to consider. This has been probably one of my favorite discussions that we've had.  Mike Berrill: Definitely. This is just so fun, just thinking about what can, what is life like on the space station? I feel like hygiene is just like, that's life.  Mike Berrill: Right.  Elisca Hicks: It is.  Host: When I'm thinking about living at home, that's how I was thinking about this podcast is like I was going through my own home.  Elisca Hicks: That's great.  Host: Thinking like how do they do this in space?  Mike Berrill: Right?  Host: So, I appreciate the work that you're doing.  Elisca Hicks: Thank you.  Host: And, working with the astronauts and making sure that we're constantly learning. And, the fact that there's crew preference involved, that's just fascinating to me. I really appreciate both of your time.  Elisca Hicks: Thank you.  Mike Berrill: Thank you for having us. It's always fun to discuss our work.  Host: Yeah, appreciate the time.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 255, “Artemis Mission Design.” I'm Gary Jordan, I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. With the Artemis I mission taking the main stage, we hope you've had a chance to dig through our collection of episodes leading up to the mission on all the different systems, programs, and of course people that have come together to make this mission a reality. It's important to note that this mission sets us up for future Artemis missions: next sending humans around the Moon, then landing humans on the lunar surface, then expanding our presence at the orbiting Gateway, new surface exploration technologies, and of course, as always, science. We're already thinking about what comes next and how these Artemis missions build on one another to continue technology demonstrations, science, and exploration on the Moon, and that prepares us for Mars. To help set the stage for Moon to Mars, there is a dedicated group at NASA's Johnson Space Center serving as a focal point for collecting as much information as necessary to design Artemis missions. It's a massive task. So to help us understand the planning and considerations needed to successfully design an Artemis mission, we're bringing back Nujoud Merancy, chief of NASA's Exploration Mission Planning office. We get into how and why we're laying the missions out the way we do. So let's get right into it. Enjoy.    [Music]  Host: Nujoud Merancy, thank you so much for coming back on Houston We Have a Podcast. Good to have you.   Nujoud Merancy: Thanks for having me, Gary.    Host: All right. One more conversation in the bank. Last time we talked, we talked about Artemis and Apollo. And we sort of did a pretty deep dive because at the time, I think art, this Artemis, the idea of Artemis was really just coming up for the agency and you sort of helped us to set the context because a lot of people were having those questions, right, how, what's, how does it necessarily compare to Apollo. Why don't we kind of start there. Just for, for our listeners that maybe didn't get a chance to do that deep dive, they can go back and listen to it -- it was episode 116, if they want to -- but just a high-level of what exactly for, for, if you were to catch someone off the street and they say, what is, you know, what's the difference here, didn't we already do the Moon, what's sort of your pitch to them?    Nujoud Merancy: So yeah, thanks. In short, right, it's a different mission for a different objective, right? So with Apollo, the objective as laid out by President Kennedy was to go to the Moon as soon as possible by, essentially by the end of that decade they were in, and return safely to Earth. So to do Apollo, you picked the easiest place on the Moon to go to, the easiest architecture so a single launch architecture, landing at the equator of the Moon or very near the equator, and coming back with a very short mission, maximum of about 13 days of a mission. With Apol, or with Artemis, what we're trying to do is really set the stage for long-duration space exploration and explore the South Pole of the Moon, where there's way more scientific interests with permanently-shadowed regions, way more opportunities to collect science data as well as support long-term technology and habitation development with longer periods of sunlight than the equator. But to do that it's higher performance, more challenging, lots more effort needed to go into it, as well as smaller budgets because we're doing it on a sustainable basis not a full-up national priority.  Host: Right.  Nujoud Merancy: So it is really a different mission architected around different objectives. And so there is a difference in what we're trying to do.    Host: OK. OK. Now the conversation we're going to get into today is really talking about diving more deep, less so into the Apollo then we did at the last episode, this one's really going deeper into the mission design for Artemis missions. Now exactly what you're saying, we're talking sustainable, we're talking stuff that's going to get us to very interesting locations on the Moon. So, and, and then, I kind of wanted to start with like your office, right, you’re mission planning, so you guys are really forward-thinking, you're thinking years in advance, you're thinking multiple missions in advance. And it's a lot of data to gather kind of now, and, and, and to inform what you're going to be doing years later. So tell me about your group and your office and your efforts that goes into mission planning?    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So mission planning, in a very general sense, is the mission engineering, we're the engineers and it's largely systems engineering, which means we are integrators of all of the vehicles, the piece parts. So we don't design the vehicles, but we have to make them all work together and the mission with flight operations, the crew, all the constraints that go into it, to how do you do a mission to meet the objectives. So it's really an integration function. We have to work throughout: early on we help set the requirements for what you're going to need, say in a human landing system, how much performance do you need from what orbits, things like that; and then as it goes through development we work with all the teams, the Orion spacecraft, human lander, Gateway, how do you put all those pieces together to get to the spot on the Moon? So it is, it's a lot of working with the teams, integrating across them, and coming up with solutions in the form of the mission design to meet the objectives.    Host: OK. So you're pulling on a little bit of the, the engineering design of some of the components of Artemis. You're pulling on the operations team to learn about how they do operations. And you're, that's a lot of data gathering and a lot of stuff to pull, and early, too, right, because there's, like we're, we're, we're years away from some of this stuff, but you have to do it like now.    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. It's very big picture.  Host: Yeah, right.  Nujoud Merancy: So you've got to really want to like sort of build the puzzle, right? I have all these pieces, all of us are working our pieces, everyone needs to be successful, and in order for everyone to be successful all the piece parts have to be successful. If anything doesn't work, if it's, this is a bad solution for one program, well, that makes the whole thing fall apart. So in a way it's kind of a great thing because it is really the epitome of getting everyone to work together…  Host: Right.  Nujoud Merancy: …but it is also a big challenge because you're working essentially with the world's biggest LEGOS of how do we put these things together.    Host: [Laughter] That's really a good analogy. I know, like I was a big LEGO guy and, and when I was, when I was a kid, I totally get that. Now in terms of the, the idea of bringing all these pieces together and, and thinking about you, you talk about like defining requirements and that sort of thing, in terms of mission planning, we're still kind of at this like bird's eye view right now, in terms of mission planning, how, how solid do you guys try to make it and how do you factor in just natural changes over time as you learn more information, as things become developed, as you get a better idea about, you know, production and manufacturing schedules and this sort of thing, how do you, how do you come up with an idea early but then have it be malleable enough to meet everybody else's mission objectives?    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. I mean, that's a big part of what the team has to do.  It’s, actually it's an iterative process, right? We think it'll work this way, but as the vehicle design develops or we get more data and we study, right, we have to plan for all the contingencies too. So as you peel back the onion layers you always find another layer underneath. So you just keep going and going and iterate on it. So things like Artemis I, which we’re about to launch, originally we planned a 26-day fixed mission. It was only going to be one length, but as we started doing mission design and working with the programs we found we wanted to land during daylight to collect parachute data on Orion. So in order to do that we had to make it a variable mission length. So that's why we have a 26-to-43-day mission, depending on the day we launch. So it's that sort of changes that occur through the mission design to meet the objectives a program needs. So it's just a really clear example of, really we'll change the length of the mission so we can target that landing at daylight, and that's exactly how that sort of iteration goes.    Host: Got it. OK. Yeah. And we will spend some time specifically on Artemis I just because we're, you know, it's happening, you know? Like, you're like, we're, it's like, it's like very around the corner. But then of course, you know, Artemis II, III, I mean this, like that part of your, your office is really thinking far ahead. Let's keep up here with, with mission design and just some of the, really what I want to get into is just some of the considerations. Get a full understanding, because you're talking about pulling all the different LEGO pieces together to build this beautiful LEGO sculpture, right, you're, you're, you're pulling all of these pieces. Want to get an understanding of some of those pieces, right? And I think one, one of that comes naturally to, to mind for me is the manufacturing of certain things. We've had a lot of different program representatives on, they talk about Orion and there's multiple Orions and iterations of Orion that are in certain readiness of manufacturing. Of course, SLS and the Space Launch System has its own manufacturing, but then these different block builds that change over time, right? You have ground systems, you have the Gateway, you know, all these programs they're building and they're, they're doing all these things on their schedules. How do you learn all, all about that, and then factor that into these future missions and, and the ready, having an understanding of basically when things are going to be ready?   Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So a lot of it starts with what's the objective of the mission, and then you sort of decompose and assign the pieces to each vehicle, right? SLS and Orion are just get the crew safely to and from lunar orbit. The lunar orbit, we have agreed, it's an agreement essentially between all the parties -- Gateway, Orion, HLS (human landing system) --  which orbit we go to so they can meet up and you know, they literally dock and come together there and transfer the crew. So you have to start at that, right: what does it require, what's each program's part to play and then they do their work to analyze to it, and any issues that come up come back to us and we help, you know, solve them, right? We'll look across all the programs and find a solution that works for everyone and can be done on the timetable. But yes, as you mentioned, right, there are upgrades that's going to change. One mission doesn't look like the previous mission, and we get to keep building. So that's part of being sustainable is to be able to keep incorporating new things, new systems along the way. So, right, we had Orion, Gateway, HLS, now we have our first human landing system in Starship. So how do we work with Starship to complete that part of the mission? So yeah, the goal is to keep being flexible and incorporate these things as they come in. A lot of times it'll be upgrades in performance, like SLS going from Block 1 to Block 1B when it gets a bigger upper stage. So yeah, it's a really fun puzzle that keeps growing and growing and we get more and more performance along the way.    Host: You got to love that stuff to really, to really go into it, right? You got to love the planning, you got to love, all right, like it's almost, I feel like there's an aspect of creativity to it too. Like how, like here's these new and interesting problems we like, and here's a, here's how we think is the best way to solve it. You just got, you got to have the right people that love that kind of stuff to really…   Nujoud Merancy: And I think it's really underappreciated, right?  Host: Yeah. Yeah.   Nujoud Merancy: Everyone thinks of engineering as math and numbers and very hardcore things, but we got to be super-creative…  Host: Yes.  Nujoud Merancy: …like what's a better way to solve this problem? And it's not always what's the best technical answer, but what can we actually afford, get done on schedule, analyze and verify? I mean, it's the engineering piece is a part of it but some of that is the creativity of what is a good way to solve this problem.  Host: There's, so another one you mentioned in terms of the, the considerations that you're pulling in to make, to design some of these missions, you talked about orbits. You're like, depending on what orbit we go into, and I know it changes over time when we're thinking about Artemis missions, right? So Artemis I, we talk about DRO (distant retrograde orbit) quite a bit, right? And then as we get into a sustainability of, of, of Artemis missions, NRHO (near-rectilinear halo orbit) comes, comes into consideration. You talked about Artemis I having this wide range of 20-something days to 40-something days, right? Let's, let's do a little bit of, of a dive into orbital mechanics and just sort of understand…I mean, or, Orbital Mechanics 101. What's happening that creates these wide stretches of time, 20-something to 40-something days? What are the different orbits? Let's, let's do a little bit of a dive into orbital mechanics.   Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So orbital mechanics and the sort of the architecture is the trajectories are what underpins all that mission design. So for Artemis I, you said DRO: for the listeners, that's a distant retrograde orbit. It's called that because it's very far from the Moon, very high altitude, so about 40,000 miles from the surface of the Moon in a sort of ellipsoid, and it’s retrograde because it's rotating the opposite direction the Moon is going. So just sort of backwards if you look at the way the Moon is. So that orbit we're used, it's in the Earth- Moon plane, means it's flat, it's around the Moon’s equator, and it's used because it's a very stable orbit. So if you want to park something there, you don't need a lot of pro -- you don't need any propulsion capability -- to stay there, but it's a really good test orbit. It came up early in designs of lunar architectures, and so that's why we're using it for Artemis I. And it's also very good at what we need, which is that variable duration. We, we, because we were in the DRO, we found that it could be used to do this duration change to get what we wanted for Earth entry conditions. So, yeah, so this orbit is a really good stable orbit, meets all of the objectives to test Orion in deep space. But whereas when we move to Artemis II we're actually not going to go into a lunar orbit: we're first going to do a high Earth orbit followed by a lunar free return flyby. So that allows us to check out Orion with the crew systems around Earth; very safe, we can abort much quicker from it. And then if everything's good, though, we'll proceed to let the crew do a lunar flyby and we actually use the Moon's gravity to slingshot back to Earth. So Artemis II was very much designed at that trajectory, that mission design, about what is the best way to do a crewed test flight. And then when we get to Artemis III and we want to land on the Moon, we go into a near-rectilinear halo orbit. So those are a lot of big words for a very large ellipsoid orbit that actually is out of plane. So rectilinear, it's about 90 degrees out of plane from Earth-Moon. So it goes down below the Moon, around below the South Pole, and that orbit is also a stable orbit but it provides that South Pole access. So very key there because on Artemis I, we're not landing on the Moon.  Host: Right.  Nujoud Merancy: So we didn't need to change the plane of the orbit. For Artemis III and beyond we want to go to the South Pole, so we're doing that orbit that orbits north-south, essentially, over the Moon.   Host: Yeah. OK. Yeah. The, the DRO and the flyby, they don't get you to the South Pole. So, so really that's one of the big considerations for NRHO is you want, you want that South Pole access?    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So that South Pole access for Gateway, long-term stability to build out a, a habitat, a cislunar habitat outpost around the Moon, and the lunar access to get down to the surface on the South Pole. So there's sort of a balance of objectives in how we selected the NRHO orbit.  Host: OK. And for Artemis I to, to, to complete the story on the DRO, distant retrograde, the reason for the, for the variation in the potential times is really, is it really just how many laps around that DRO you, you because you said it's pretty stable orbit, it's really just about laps?    Nujoud Merancy: It is. So on the shorter missions we'll stay there for half an orbit. It's a, it's a 12-day orbit period, so it takes 12 days to go just once around the orbit. So for a shorter mission we only spend six days or so in the orbit.   Host: OK.  Nujoud Merancy: When it's a longer mission we go one and a half times around the Moon, so you spend about 16 days in that orbit.    Host: Yeah. OK. All right. So, now we're zooming ahead, right, we're just, we're talking about Artemis missions and just some of the considerations, obviously you alluded to NRHO giving you access to the South Pole to land on it, obviously, landing sites are one of those things. And actually, I think at this very moment you and I are talking, I'm sorry…  Nujoud Merancy: I just left the press conference, I was listening to it before I came over.    Host: [Laughter] …I was saying, I feel so bad because there was just, just the way that things happen, but they are talking about the landing sites right now…  Nujoud Merancy: Yes.  Host: …as, as we speak. And that's very exciting. So, so those are things that you have to consider. It, the way that NRHO kind of interacts with the landing sites, is there, is there any considerations there, like maybe time of day and, and shadows of, of the Sun or like, what are the considerations for actually landing in these South Pole regions of the Moon?    Nujoud Merancy: Yes. The, how we land on the South Pole is going to be very challenging. It's a lot of opportunity, but that also makes it very challenging, right? So when you're on the South Pole or any, either North or South Pole of the Moon, the Sun is very oblique, meaning it's very low on the horizon. It's never more than six degrees above the horizon. So if you know, you look at sunset and the Sun is just above the, the horizon that you're looking at, that's what it'll look like all the time on the South Pole. But because of that, the Moon can be, or the Sun can drop just below the horizon of the Moon and just above it a lot. So we end up with periods where you could have days of sunlight in a row on one spot, but then you'll have shadows for days at a time. So we've got to time our landing on the South Pole so that we land in the very particular spot that will have Sun for at least six days because our surface missions will be about six days long. So there's a whole lot of analysis. There's a really big team across the agency and including the vendors out there and the scientists that look at these, the data of the terrain, the Sun, the conditions, are there boulders, to pick where is a good opportunity to land, and then we have to time that with when Orion and Starship will meet for Artemis III in orbit. And there's a weekly period, it's a seven-day period in that NRHO, so we have to time all of that, and then pick a landing site when HLS can make the descent to a spot that has sunlight on it.    Host: Ah.  So how do you, if you're talking about, so one of the things that, just in regular human spaceflight, right, this happens literally all the time is, just, you don't always get off the pad when you want to get off the pad. You know, you always have weather considerations, right? There's, even for Artemis, we're looking at these launch periods and then each of these has to come with its own analysis. When you start factoring in stuff like that, right, so when, if you're, if you're in a launch period, if you're in a launch window, and you are going to land on the surface of the Moon, does the, does your landing site change as launch opportunities change because of lighting?    Nujoud Merancy: It can.    Host: Interesting.    Nujoud Merancy: So yeah. So we're still working through how exactly we want to set up the conditions. So we're looking at how much variability do we have in the vehicle performance, can we tweak the orbit here or there, how many sites do we need? We hope, I mean, it would be a lot easier if we can get down to just one site.   Host: Right.  Nujoud Merancy: But because one site isn't available all year long with sunlight, you have to then start, you know, figuring how many sites do I need to look at, or can I slightly adjust the orbit to get to a different site? So we're working through all of that right now. And yes, the goal is to have lots of launch opportunities because you always have, you're getting a very complex rocket off the ground, whether it's Starship or SLS, they need to get through all the weather conditions, right, if there's a storm. So the more opportunities we can give, the more likely we have success. So planning for those landing sites, we then have to work backwards to make sure that we can launch the rocket and give ourselves a lot of probability of success in doing so.    Host: Got it. OK. Now another consideration I wanted to talk about was the, a lot of the engineering considerations, right? So Orion’s, can, you know, Orion's solar power and like battery considerations, ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System), right, how long they can support life, and so, so, a lot of these, a lot of these different engineering considerations for how, how these spacecrafts, how these things will work in orbit; how are you taking some of these considerations and building them into, you know, for example, you talked about the surface operations being like six days, right, so you have to, there's, there's certain things that you have to consider to, to make that happen. Orion's going to be in orbit that time. What are some of the engineering considerations that you're putting in?    Nujoud Merancy: Yes. At a very fundamental level, right, you know, you only have so much stuff that you can bring with you. So we have certain size oxygen tanks, water tanks, food onboard. So yeah, the mission design then has to account for, I only have so many days I can let the crew travel to the Moon, so many days will spend in orbit, so many days HLS could be on the surface with their food and water system. So yeah, so we have to work through all of that. There's a partnership: that's part of the big integration challenge, right, is does this vehicle have enough commodities on it, can you share commodities? Say, say one vehicle has extra food; well, we'll make sure we use that in the planning so that we don't have to carry stuff we don't need. It's very hard to go to the Moon, so we need to account for everything, make sure we're not leaving any gaps, but also make sure we're not taking stuff we don't need, and because that could free up space for say a science payload. So, right, there's a lot of integration that's going on: how many days do we spend where, how much food, the engineering systems, and then of course planning for all the contingencies, just in case anything goes wrong along the way.  Host: That's a huge one, right? So in terms of your planning, you, you mentioned this right up, right up the top, that was like one of the first things that you mentioned was, it's, you're already explaining how hard it is just from just like a normal, normal planning. [Laughter]  Nujoud Merancy: The nominal mission is hard enough.   Host: [Laughter] Right.   Nujoud Merancy: And then you add the contingencies.    Host: Exactly. Right? So like Orion, for example, Orion's built to sustain, you know, just in case something were to go wrong, it's got like a lot of these redundancies built in for exactly that, for contingencies. You got contingencies where astronauts can go into the suit for a couple of days. How do you build that into like, not only are you designing a mission and you have to be flexible depending on, you know, which day you launch and you have to do the lighting considerations, but now you have to think, OK, if something were to go wrong at this spot, what do we do if we were to go this spot? Are you thinking about that too?   Nujoud Merancy: Yes. Absolutely, right? It takes days to get home from the Moon. So you can't just say, OK, well I quit if something goes wrong and we'll be home in an hour, right? It's days. So everything needs to be planned, and this is where communication, right, it takes a big team, all the teams doing this communicating and working with each other, because we have to rely on each other's support, whether you're on HLS or Orion or SLS to, to work through this. And that's where, you know, that's the other thing, engineering's all about communication. And “how do we solve this problem?” takes everyone talking to each other and sorting through the problems.    Host: Very important, very important. All right. One more consideration that I at least have written down and then we can explore other ones that I might be, be forgetting, are of course, the people, the astronauts, right? Of course, we talked about the environmental control and life support systems as being one of the things you have to, you have to factor in, it's just the, it's the Orion ECLSS is designed to support humans for, I think, three weeks, right?    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. Four crew for 21 days    Host: Four crew for 21 days, right, so that's a, that's a big consideration there. The radiation limit, right: now we're leaving low Earth orbit, now, now people are entering into the, the Moon; are there any considerations for how, how long they can be there, what are their radiation limits that you have to plan for, for, you know, would we even come close to that three weeks when it comes to radiation limits?    Nujoud Merancy: So, you know, radiation is a big factor. When you leave low Earth orbit, you're still protected by the atmosphere and the magnetosphere when you're in low Earth orbit. So if you're on ISS for six months, you're getting a certain amount of radiation dose. When we start planning missions out to the Moon, a few weeks is equivalent to that six months on ISS. So yes, the human factors team have to do a lot of consideration about radiation, but we also have to just sort of factor it into what's acceptable dosage, because if we want to explore the Moon and you want to do it well, we need to go and we need to be there for a significant amount of time. So then you need radiation shelters too, because one of the important things is there's so much radiation. You get a sort of background radiation just for being at the Moon, but if there's a solar particle event, which is a big solar storm, and lets off a burst of radiation, how do you protect the crew? So all of the vehicles will have radiation shelters, plans, and things like that, and it's really how do you pack a lot of stuff around the crew to block that radiation. So, yeah, so you have to sort of plan for these things because the solar particle event, if you're out at the Moon, is a significant dose all at once. So you have to have shelters for those, and then the medical teams have to account for just sort of that background dose you get just for being outside the magnetosphere.    Host: OK. So it's, it sounds like it's more of like, more of the engineering design of some of these different vehicles that is really probably one of the drivers of radiation protection, more so than actually planning a mission around certain things, right?    Nujoud Merancy: Right.   Host: OK.  Nujoud Merancy: We'll, we'll have to fly through what are called the Van Allen radiation belts to get to the Moon.   Host: Right.   Nujoud Merancy: You just do the math for the accounting on how much exposure that is. The medical teams factor that in for all of the crew members, you know, lifetime considerations will come into effect. You don't want, you can't send the same person out there a hundred times because they start to accumulate a lot of radiation. But in this case there's a lot of engineering going into radiation shelters for those, really, on, one-off events if they occur.    Host: Right. Right. And you know, there's a certain amount of prediction I think when it comes to those that you can have insight into, but then there's, there's a lot of times where it just, you know, just sort of happens, right?   Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. They, they're essentially random.   Host: Yeah.  Nujoud Merancy: There's a, there's some probability it'll occur in any given day, but you don't know when that would be.    Host: Right. Exactly. Exactly. All right. Other considerations that maybe I'm forgetting that is probably more prominent in your life that maybe folks like me just don't normally think about when it comes to trying to put a mission plan together.   Nujoud Merancy: I mean, I think one of the things to keep in mind is it's a, it's a three-body problem. The Earth, Moon, the spacecraft are all gravity interacting with each other. Things like the distant retrograde orbit and near-rectilinear halo orbit, they're actually under the influence of both Earth and Moon gravity at the same time, so you're sort of balancing, you're sort of surfing the gravitational waves in those orbits.  But then we also have to plan for the Sun. And so you mentioned solar arrays and stuff and eclipsing, so we, you know, the, the trajectory experts are actually doing math with, you know, four big bodies all at the same time: everything's moving, the Earth's rotating around the Sun, the Moon's rotating around the Earth, the spacecraft is rotating around the Moon. So all of that's going on and we have, so there's a lot of calculation behind it to keep all of the, keep track of where everything is.    Host: OK. So, OK. Here's, here's like an instance that maybe comes to mind, you tell me if this is actually like a, like maybe an issue or maybe it's a non-issue. Is like, for example, like you're saying these three bodies…a lunar eclipse: like would, would you be able to fly a mission during a lunar eclipse because maybe you wouldn't get this, the solar power that's required? Is that like something that you have to plan around?   Nujoud Merancy: That is absolutely something we have to plan around. And that's actually one of the drivers for the orbit we picked…  Host: Really.   Nujoud Merancy: …the near-rectilinear halo orbit. So one of the special things about the orbit and, in very particular, the particular size orbit we picked was because it's called a 9:2 resonance: so for every two lunar months, it makes nine orbits. That's where the six and a half days comes from. But in that resonance we always pass below the shadow of the Earth, because being out near the Moon's distance, that Earth shadow is big. It's about three to four hours if we were to fly through the Earth’s shadow, which is very hard on your power systems and thermal systems. So by picking that particular orbit for our architecture, Gateway, Orion, the Starship, whenever they're in NRHO, we'll only have very short eclipses of just the Moon. So we can, we sit, we essentially picked an architecture that plans around Earth eclipsing, and a lunar eclipse, essentially, that could follow on the same time.    Host: Wow. Yeah. NRHO is looking pretty good the more that we talk about it, right? It's, you said it's, it's easier to sustain with limited amounts of prop[ellant], it gets you that South Pole access, and you have to, you, you have a little bit more flexibility when working around difficult lighting situations.    Nujoud Merancy: Right. We make the vehicle design easier because we can work the power and thermal problem and avoid extremely long eclipsing. So yeah, there's a lot, all those design factors went into this architecture early on.    Host: Interesting. OK. All right, cool. Yeah. I love this. I love this. Yeah, we'll, we'll when we we're, we're next going to dive into a couple of the Artemis missions, just to sort of better understand maybe at a deeper level, each of these, each of these considerations that we were talking about and maybe we'll reveal more of the considerations as, as we go through them. Let's, of course, start with Artemis I. So for those that are maybe like really want to tune into the Artemis I mission and really understand what's happening, can you give our listeners a, an understanding of exactly what, what, what is the mission design from launch to splashdown, talking about distant retrograde orbit? What is, you know, like why, why is this mission designed the way that that is?    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So Artemis I is an uncrewed test flight. So fundamentally in the mission design, we wanted to make sure we demonstrated all of the vehicle systems in their planned long-term environment. So for Orion that means deep space conditions, SLS the whole launch sequence, and for our ground support systems that countdown and the recovery of Orion. So fundamentally, how do we make sure everything gets tested on this flight? The more data, the better, so a longer mission the better. We don't have crew on board so this is kind of a chance where you can stress things out a little bit and not be risking human lives. So we're going to launch from the Kennedy Space Center. SLS will take off with Orion on top. It's about an eight-minute ride uphill and then the core stage and the SRBs (solid rocket booster) will have done their job, they'll have separated, and the interim cryogenic propulsion stage will coast with Orion to apogee, which is the highest part of the Earth orbit. It performs a burn to raise perigee; Orion will be all checked out during this time, make sure everything's good. And then it'll perform a trans-lunar injection, so ICPS will perform the big burn that sends Orion to the Moon. All of that will occur in less than two hours from launch. So a lot of stuff happens right up front. And then after that Orion's on its way to the Moon and will spend about a week on its way to the Moon, and then perform a flyby of the Moon. And we use that flyby of the Moon, we're using the lunar gravity to slingshot up into the distant retrograde orbit, and then Orion will do a burn to stabilize in that orbit and then continue checking out systems. So there, when we get a, you know, very stable orbit, we've been checking out systems the whole way outbound. The team will continue to check out systems in the orbit. If everything looks good, Orion will perform the burn to leave orbit, fly back by the Moon and use the Moon's gravity to reverse the process and slingshot Orion back towards Earth. So again, Orion will spend about a week headed home and perform a direct entry. So this is when things get really exciting. At about 400,000 feet altitude above Earth, Orion will be going about 25,000 miles per hour. So this is one of the major objectives is testing that heat shield on Orion. This is all the system checkout, right, from beginning to end, we get to test the heat shield, the largest heat shield flown for a human spacecraft, and verify that that, and all of the parachutes, work and splash down in the Pacific Ocean, very gently, right by San Diego, where the Navy ships will be waiting to pick up Orion. So all of this is designed to test the systems needed, so we can say the rocket, the spacecraft, everything's good for crew.    Host: Got it. OK. Yes, we are, yeah, we want to make sure that this is good to go. The first thing one, one of the first things you mentioned when you were talking about it was putting stress on the vehicle to really test it out, right? Now, when it comes to, when, when you were approached to say, hey, we want to make a design, that's going to fulfill all these objectives and we really want to push this spacecraft to the limit, right, what exactly is, what exactly is being pushed here, what exactly is being tested, and you know, to, to maybe some of the higher limits than you would normally kind of think about for, for a crewed mission, what exactly is happening to really make sure this, this guy's good to go?   Nujoud Merancy: Well, I mean, it's really kind of the first for all of it, so any, the first time you do anything, but also, right, a 43-day mission, the first time you fly Orion, we wouldn't do that with crew, if this were the very first time, with crew, right?   Host: Right.  Nujoud Merancy: But, you know, we need the full, it's not so much that you're pushing it above its design limit, but we're at the design limits for all these things.  Host: Got it.   Nujoud Merancy: The reentry. We're using most of the prop in Orion, we want to make sure that all the systems get demonstrated. So really, you're testing everything, the batteries, and it's not that we're stressing it beyond design, but we are using the systems as designed and demonstrating that they'll work.    Host: OK. Using the systems as designed to get it to, as you mentioned, that, this is the perfect phrase, design limit, is just, you want to like, this is as far as we think that these systems will go and let's, let's see, let's see if it actually does it, right?    Nujoud Merancy: If we, you know, we're doing everything at only 50%, how would you have the confidence for the crew? So we're really doing everything exactly as we think it should work, so that we have the confidence it will.   Host: Got it. OK. Now you, the, when you, when fast forwarding to the exciting part, when you were talking about the exciting part of, of the direct entry of, of Orion. Now, this one, I know there was, for example, going way back to -- 2015? -- EFT-1.  Nujoud Merancy: December 2014.  Host: December 2014, OK, thank you for correcting me. EFT-1. Now that one, of course, tested the heat shield. It did not go all the way to the Moon, right? Is there a, is there a benefit of testing the heat shield by this particular trajectory?    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So when we did Exploration Flight Test 1 it, we launched on a Delta IV Heavy, which is a much smaller rocket than SLS. And we pushed that rocket as to its limit, and it got Orion as high as it could, but it reentered it around 20,000 miles per hour. So, but heating and all of the, you know, effects of aerodynamics are exponential. So that last 5,000 miles per hour is actually very important. But it's also very hard to test heat shields on the ground because you need very expensive arc jet facilities, and they can only do coupons that are like a couple inches in size. Orion has a five-meter heat shield.   Host: Yeah.  Nujoud Merancy: So being able to do that full-size heat shield, all of the data needed, in the flight environment, at the speeds it needs to be going, it's truly something you can only fully test in flight. So we have a lot of confidence in the heat shield design, but we really need that lunar entry speed and all of the associated things to finish collecting the data. And there's a lot of sensors embedded in the heat shield. I mean, there's a ton of sensors all over SLS and Orion for the purpose of collecting data, to validate that all of the designs and the models and the work on the ground is correct.    Host: Of course. Now, of course, that's, that data is going to be very precious to a lot of people. Is it also precious to you? Are you going to, is anything on Artemis I going to affect any of the mission designs, planning, anything that you for, for your group, for Artemis II and beyond?    Nujoud Merancy: Oh, absolutely. So really, and it's leaning on the vehicle programs themselves, so SLS and Orion, you know, we, we have math models; they have uncertainties, right? So you may have some mar, we have margins on everything. So once you get flight data, you can start to refine like, oh, this worked better than we thought, and things like that. So they can start to remove some margins, which could provide benefits downstream. And, you know, once you've flown things, you know, no one's ever flown a spacecraft and not found something interesting, right? Whether it's ISS or shuttle or Soyuz, you know, everything has been flown and there's something you find you learn when you do it. So we absolutely need to fly it, understand any characteristics of that flight, and it will affect our mission designs downstream.   Host: Got it. All right. Let's go to Artemis II now. Now this one, of course you mentioned, you, like right off the bat for Artemis I, really long mission, you really want to test, you're testing the systems, you're testing the vehicle. Now you have the human consideration: a lot shorter. What, what's the design? How did you, how did you figure out the design of Artemis II?    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So Artemis II is very different than anything, doesn't look like any other mission that's been flown. And the point of Artemis II, being the first time we fly crew, is testing out those life support systems, the exercise, just the procedures of the crew being in the vehicle. So this is a 10-day mission, but very different: instead of going to the Moon on the first day, right -- ICPS, SLS and ICPS will sort of do the same thing they do on Artemis I, but they'll only put Orion in this high-Earth orbit. So it'll be in a orbit, it's, it's an ellipse around the Earth,  it's about 70,000 [kilometers] at apogee. So the highest point, it's still, it's very high above the Earth, but not near the Moon.   Host: OK.  Nujoud Merancy: And it's a 24-hour orbit. So one day to go once around the Earth in it.  But that orbit will allow us a day's worth of checkout time on all the life support systems, the exercise, you know, the first time the waste management system is flown, all those things will be checked out in Earth orbit. If for any reason something's not going right, then we can abort back to Earth in a relatively short period of time.    Host: Oh, OK.    Nujoud Merancy: But if everything goes as expected, and we have a lot of confidence in that, Orion will complete that trans-lunar injection burn and send Orion and the crew out to fly by the Moon. So it'll be much closer to Apollo 8, but we won't enter lunar orbit. We just use the Moon's gravity to slingshot back around.    Host: OK. OK. So I, I totally get the, the, the high-Earth orbit, or the Earth orbit part. You want to make sure everything's good before you commit to going to the Moon. Now, if you're testing out a lot of the systems in Earth orbit, what's the benefit of going around the Moon? What, what's the added benefit of the test by sending humans out there?  Nujoud Merancy: Well, then we're starting to collect data with time, right? So we can send them to the Moon, now you're checking it out in the cislunar environment, and you know, any engineering data, the more you can collect the better. So that's why we, we call this a hybrid flyby because it's a hybrid of an Earth mission and a Moon mission all in one. So the advantage is really that, you know, we do get to go to the Moon with humans for the first time in over 50 years.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Nujoud Merancy: Can't underestimate how exciting that's going to be, but right, it is a hybrid mission where we've sort of combined the two of an Earth and a Moon mission to collect a broader suite of data.    Host: Yeah. OK. All right. So now Artemis II, you're getting a lot of data about humans in the lunar environment. You're getting a lot more confidence in the systems that are going to sustain humans in that environment. All of a sudden you jump into Artemis III. Now, there's a lot that goes into that. So let's, let's talk Artemis III.    Nujoud Merancy: Yeah. So Artemis III, and actually I want to step back one, right…   Host: Oh, sure.  Nujoud Merancy: …before Artemis III, the Human Landing System will have an uncrewed demo[nstration] demonstrating their systems landing on the Moon. So as we talk about building up systems, right, SLS and Orion will have a demonstration, HLS will have their uncrewed demonstration, and then we get to Artemis III, and we put it all together.  Host: Got it.  Nujoud Merancy: Right. So Artemis III, SLS and Orion, will launch. And at this point HLS will be waiting in, NRHO orbit. So it'll be waiting, it'll have launched first, it'll be fueled up and ready to go, we know it'll be solid and the systems checked out, and then we launch the crew to meet it. They'll meet in that near-rectilinear halo orbit. They spend just a couple days together getting HLS prepared for the surface, and then two crew will descend to the surface and two will stay in Orion. So kind of a split crew system, similar to what Apollo did. In this case, two crew will then land on the surface, they'll have about a six-day stay on the surface performing that first EVA (extravehicular activity). So also, another system coming online for Artemis III are the spacesuits.   Host: Yep.  Nujoud Merancy: So the first exploration spacesuits will be onboard. The crew will do the science, collect data; we'll know how, how HLS works, how the spacesuits work. And then after the six days they'll return to NRHO, redock with Orion, put the crew all back together, and then Orion will bring the crew safely home again. So it'll be a very exciting mission…  Host: Yeah.   Nujoud Merancy: …obviously, a lot of firsts on that one again, too, but a lot of the testing that leads up to it as well.    Host: OK. All right, let's, let's dive into some of the interesting parts about that. Particularly, let's start with the lander, right? So you talked about, you're going to rendezvous with the lander in NRHO and then do a couple of days of checkouts. That's, that's a decent amount of time for, for checking out what, what exactly is the crew doing to get it ready for landing?    Nujoud Merancy: Well, there's actually a lot in the orbit mechanics, right?  Host: Oh, interesting.  Nujoud Merancy: Orion arrives to meet in our, HLS at a certain part of the orbit, and we have about three to five days, or three to four days, before it's the point at which it's efficient for HLS to go down to the surface. So part of it’s the orbit mechanics, but part of it also is that crews have to dock and you have to open the hatches.  Host: Yeah.   Nujoud Merancy: You have to go in HLS in space, you have to get the spacesuits prepared for the spacewalks and stuff. So their crew will actually have very full days doing all of the system checkouts and the spacesuit work they need to, to prepare for that surface mission.    Host: Ah, OK.    Nujoud Merancy: So the crew will be very busy in those few days we, they have, but it's also the benefit of orbit mechanics is we have those few days before HLS descends to the surface.    Host: Got it. OK. What are the drivers behind the six-day lunar excursion, right, because of course, when you, when Neil [Armstrong] and Buzz [Aldrin] landed it was just a couple of hours, right, but now we're talking about first time, right off the bat for the Artemis mission, it's like a week, right? So what, what are they doing?   Nujoud Merancy: The driver is the duration of the orbit. So, HLS goes down to the surface, Orion is completing the lap around the Moon, essentially, and then at the optimal time, HLS takes back off again and meets Orion.   Host: OK.  Nujoud Merancy: So the driver is this combination of the orbit mechanics and where Orion is in the orbit when HLS comes back up.  Host: Got it.    Nujoud Merancy: You know, long term plans are to get to 30-day missions on the surface of the Moon. So at this point a week at a time is biting it off in a smaller chunk.   Host: [Laughter] So there's OK. So that the orbit makes a lot of sense, but then of course that's going to have to be one of the big considerations for the design of HLS and, and, the spacesuits is it's got to have enough solar power, enough food, enough battery power for the suits and all of this stuff to really make sure that astronauts can have a, have a decent, very productive six days.   Nujoud Merancy: Right. And when we talk about contingencies we're already working out these things, planning for it. There are times HLS can leave the surface and get back to Orion at non-optimal times, as well as sometimes it might be easier to just stay on the surface, right? If a spacesuit breaks, well, OK, just stay in the capsule, right? So, you know, the combination of how you deal with different contingencies, so we are working through that, you know, having spare commodities on board, oxygen and water, or, you know, what is your decision about how you respond to any given situation that might occur.  Host: OK. So built into it is, automatically, we're not just thinking six days, we're thinking, you're thinking contingencies, right? So you got to make sure you're prepared for well beyond six days just in case.    Nujoud Merancy: Right. Right. If, if for some reason there's a problem with that landing, they can just take back off and meet Orion, right? You know, those types of things are already in work, what are the options in there as well.  Host: OK. Wow. This is awesome. Now, now this is such an interesting program, Artemis, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of work’s being put into it, there's a lot of infrastructure being put into, like, just really everywhere around the United States to supporting Artemis missions going beyond. And I feel like, particularly for you, you know, one of the things we're thinking about is just, you know, why we're doing this is, is Artemis, there's a lot of, there's a lot of interesting scientific things that we can discover on the Moon, I think, like I've talked to the, the geologists, the lunar geologists, man are they really excited to get some of the…  Nujoud Merancy: Oh, they're so excited.    Host: [Laughter] That's, it's unbelievable talking to them. They've like, they're, we've been using the same samples for, from Apollo for a while, and now it's like, oh, we're going to get some good stuff, we're going to get some stuff from the South Pole.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, it's very exciting. I mean, there's only like 800-ish pounds of material that's been brought back from the Moon, which is not very much in the grand scheme of things.    Host: Exactly. And I mean, they do have it from interesting locations, but this is just going to be a lot and this, but this is really, I think what's really cool about this is there's so much engineering that's going into the design of a lot of these components, right, we're already talking about Orion, we're talking about SLS, we need to circle back on Gateway, we, I think we need to talk about that a little bit, but there's so much that's going to inform us about Mars, right, because you've already, one of the things I think you've mentioned right up top, Nujoud, was, like, the Moon is hard. Talk about, like, and we, I hope for our listeners this is becoming abundantly clear: it's just like, there's a lot of challenges that just go with the Moon. And all of the different considerations for lighting and this, that, and the other thing; Mars is just so much harder, right? So it's like, I think it's, to me, and, and I do want to hear like your perspective on this, the Moon does such a good job of preparing for Mars, testing all these different systems, getting the operations down of all these different, you know, bodies and, and in the solar system. From your perspective, from a mission perspective or mission planning perspective of all of that, do you feel the same way, that Artemis does a good job of preparing for Mars?    Nujoud Merancy: Absolutely. So preparing for Mars, right, just to characterize it, right: if you're in low-Earth orbit at the space station, you're a few hours from home; when we go to the Moon, we're days from home; and when you go to Mars, you’re months from home. So just scale the challenge with those durations of time, and that's the challenge in mission planning. So being able to build our flight systems that can be good at the Moon and good for contingencies that are days long, a week long, right, that's just the next small step towards what we need, are vehicles that are good for months at a time. And if something goes wrong on the way to Mars there isn't an easy, there's, there's really no easy way to turn around.   Host: Right.  Nujoud Merancy: You can shave a little bit off the time by trying to abort, but it's not really a quick way home, any way you go to Mars. So being able to build up our systems and capabilities in that sort of stepwise fashion is fundamental to making Mars a success.    Host: Got it.   Nujoud Merancy: And we can also demonstrate, right, partial gravity operations on the Moon, partial gravity operations on Mars. You know, transitioning from long durations in space to the surface for the crew, huge challenge there, as well as the technologies and systems. A lot of the systems are very similar, whether you're going to be on the Moon or Mars, there's some differences for different things, but the Moon is absolutely a step towards Mars.    Host: Wow. OK. So then, Artemis IV and beyond, right? Like, I think this is part, part of the interesting thing is of course we talked about the lunar scientists who are just so ecstatic to get some of the samples, sample collection, all these, visiting various interesting locations for that is obviously going to be something, but the evolution of Artemis IV, you talked about this being a sustainable program, right, so this is where we really start seeing Gateway. This is really when we start pushing, you mentioned we're starting with six-day surface operations going to 30-day operations, right? How from, from in your perspective, from a mission planning, how does that evolve over time to get more and more complex? What are, what are you guys working on right now?    Nujoud Merancy: So we're already working with the Gateway program and all the other systems, right? So when we put Gateway out there that allows us to start staging things in lunar orbit, we'll aggregate HLS and Orion at the Gateway, we'll be able to do long duration, cislunar, microgravity operations that will be able to then feed into those surface operations. So where you're talking about building systems out, and that's where we, you know, Artemis IV and beyond is we, really where we start exploring, right? If you look at it, Artemis III is kind of like Apollo 11: can we get there? But after Apollo 12 and beyond, that's when they really started doing the science. That was the exploration that was happening. So when we start at Artemis IV and beyond, we'll really start building the systems, building the time in space and on the surface, and building up to those 30-day missions. So Apol, Artemis IV isn't going to be 30 days, right? It'll be a little while because we'll need habitats on the surface, we'll need rovers on the surface to get to those 30 days. So there's more to come, yeah. The next one would be Gateway getting into orbit and being able to aggregate systems and logistics there, and then longer and longer surface missions.    Host: OK. So then what's, you know, obviously – Artemis, Artemis I, talk, how, how is your group sort of excited for this mission that's really going to help you to get to this point, right, because you're making it very clear there's so much work to do, even, even, even with thinking about Artemis II and III, I mean, that's, that's a lot of work, but IV and beyond, adding habitats and rovers, I mean, this is going to be like, at its peak, Artemis is just going to be so cool. I mean, I'm, I'm pumped just thinking about it. But I wonder, I'm wonder what, what it's like from you guys?   Nujoud Merancy: I'll be honest. It doesn't yet feel real.   Host: Really?  Nujoud Merancy: Right. We've been working on this a long time, right?   Host: Yeah. Yeah.   Nujoud Merancy: There's, none of this is easy and it doesn't really matter who it is, what companies, NASA or not. It is a very big challenge and there's a lot of us that have been working on it for a long time. So I'm not sure that it's real until I'm at the Cape [Canaveral] watching the rocket take off, but trust me, I am really excited.  Host: Yeah.  Nujoud Merancy: And, and cannot believe, yes, we're finally doing it. And it's really like once you see the smoke and fire, we're, we're off and running.    Host: Are you, are you going to Artemis I launch?   Nujoud Merancy: I will be going to the launch.  Host: OK. I'm so incredibly jealous. You got to tell me, we'll, we'll have you on again after, afterwards, and you tell me if, if watching that rocket go up, if it felt real to you.    Nujoud Merancy: OK. [Laughter] When the rumbles in your stomach…  Host: When, when the rumbles, yeah. I'm going to wait for my invite to go out. I got to work. I got to work it from here, but, but…   Nujoud Merancy: I'm sorry. You're going to…    Host: It'll be cool. It'll be cool. But just to feel that rumble.  Nujoud Merancy: It’s going to be amazing no matter where you are.  Host: I think so. I think so. A lots to learn, Nujoud. I think when you thinking about, you know, just kind of ending with this idea of exploration and just sort of why we do what we do, you mentioned working on this for a really long time, you know, and, and it's not going to be real really until, until you do it. But if you work on something for a long time, you got to believe that you're doing something important, it's doing something cool. So if, when you, when you come to work every day and you start thinking about these Artemis missions and laying out the future of how humans will explore the cosmos, like, what, what's really those driving factors that get you up every day?  Nujoud Merancy: I think you're laying it out right there, right? You know, we get to make a difference. What we're doing is important and it's not just important for us or America, it's important for humanity, right? Exploring isn't just about the science return. It's about the technology. It's about the business. It's about how do we, as a human species, come together? So getting to be a part of that is huge. And, you know, sometimes we forget because you're in the day to day of it, and, you know, you just went to that meeting that did not go so well, but then you look up and you talk to other people and you realize how important it is. And so that's why you just keep at it.  Host: Yep.  Nujoud Merancy: Right. We're all in this because we believe in the mission.   Host: Yeah.   Nujoud Merancy: And it, you can't understate how important that is.    Host: Wonderfully said, Nujoud. Thank you so much. This was awesome, as always, to have you on the podcast. [Laughter]  Nujoud Merancy: Thanks for having me back, Gary.  Host: Very, very exciting stuff. Artemis is, is, is, is, there's a very fantastic future here and it's very, it's very cool to hear so much that's going in from you to just this whole idea, and I hope folks are excited for Artemis I and, and then really, what's, what's coming next is it just gets more exciting every single time. It's going to be really, really cool. So thanks for coming on.   Nujoud Merancy: Thank you.  [Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Always a pleasure to talk to Nujoud about the Artemis missions, about Orion. We've had her on a number of times. Actually, if you want to go back and listen to some of the episodes that we've had Nujoud on, first check out 116 where Nujoud and I compare the Apollo program to the Artemis program. And if you want to go way back, Nujoud was actually one of, one of our first guests, really, on the podcast. Episode 17, she gives an overview of the Orion capsule; also very relevant, even today. If you want to follow the Artemis I mission, we have a website for that, NASA.gov/Artemis-1. And of course, if you are really excited about Artemis programs after hearing our Artemis missions and, and everything that goes into Artemis, after hearing this episode, we do have a full collection of Artemis-related content. So go to our website, that's NASA.gov/johnson/HWHAP/Artemis-episodes. Or you can just navigate to our homepage, Houston We Have a Podcast, and on the left navigation check out our collection.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 219, “The Crew-3 Astronauts.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers and astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Four astronauts are ready to launch from American soil on board the SpaceX Crew Dragon for the third crew rotation mission and the fourth crewed mission with SpaceX. On board are NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, as well as Matthias Maurer of ESA, or the European Space Agency. On this episode we're going to hear from each member of the crew and learn a little bit more about them and what they think about their mission. You'll get to hear about their careers, their family, stories of their training, and you'll hear their thoughts about the importance of the mission that they're on, as well as the thoughts on their crewmates. They were a great group to interview, and they had a lot of energy and excitement. And even though three of the four of them will be first-time flyers, you'll learn quickly that they have a lot to bring to the table. So here we go: the Crew-3 astronauts Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron and Matthias Maurer. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: First up is NASA astronaut Raja Chari, commander of the Crew Dragon Endurance and the Crew-3 mission. Chari is responsible for all phases of flight from launch to re-entry. Once on board station, he'll serve as an Expedition 66 flight engineer. He was born in Milwaukee but considers Cedar Falls, Iowa, his hometown. He's a colonel in the U.S. Air Force and joins the mission with extensive experience as a test pilot. Over his career, he's accumulated more than 2,500 hours of flight time. This will be the first spaceflight for Chari, who became a NASA astronaut in 2017, and he's also a member of the Artemis Team, so, he's eligible for an assignment to a future lunar mission. Really enjoyed this conversation. So here's a little bit more about Raja Chari.  Host: Raja Chari, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Raja Chari: Thanks. Happy to be here and we get to talk about the Crew-3 mission.  Host: Yeah, yeah. It's coming right up. Not, not too far until you actually launch. How you feeling?  Raja Chari: I'm feeling pretty good. It's kind of surreal knowing that as we do some of these trips to SpaceX or different training locations, knowing that this is my second to the last trip here. This is, it is, yeah. We're counting down, to use a really bad pun.  Host: Wow. So, so after this, so you're at Johnson Space Center now. You go to Johnson Space Center one more time, and then really, it's, you're, you're getting ready for the mission.  Raja Chari: Yeah. Yep. We've got yeah two more trips to Hawthorne, and more trip to the Cape. And yeah, we're pretty much in the final stages.  Host: Wow. All right. Well I want to take this time to get to know a little bit more about you. You grew up in is it Cedar Falls, Iowa?  Raja Chari: Yep. Yeah, so I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But then moved to Cedar Falls really shortly after I was born because my dad got a job there. And then, yeah, grew up in Cedar Falls, Iowa.  Host: Cool. What was it like?  Raja Chari: It was a mix of a small town and a big city by at least by Iowa standards. So definitely not a, not a farm but also, still had that feeling of, you know, where the community was tight enough to know, you know, people knew each other whether it's through church or school, but not in a creepy way, but in the way there, where people were interested in your success, whether it was teachers or, you know, other parents. Everyone had an interest in, you know, the kids succeeding and doing well.  Host: Yeah. Was there some moment or some series of maybe classes or something that really got you interested in engineering or science kind of field?  Raja Chari: Yeah. So I went to a place called St. Patrick's School. And I think at some point in, you know I, I do have one memory of, you know, getting new tables and new equipment in the science lab there. And that struck, you know, sticks out in my mind. But I think just, you know, I was also, you know, I enjoyed doing math at the time. And so I think both those things were kind of a push towards the engineering direction. And I think, you know, my mom has pointed out that I always, always enjoyed space. I made little, you know, little spaceships out of random metal pieces around the house and would try construct, you know, little airplanes or spaceships. And then try to sell them, you know, kind of lemonade style stand on the curb. I think only my parents bought them from me. But so, some early things like that.  Host: So what, what was the inspiration for going the military route?  Raja Chari: For me it was the idea of, well, twofold. One, I really, I liked the idea of trying to fly. I think really the, the military piece of that, though, was, you know, I definitely had a, I wouldn't been able to put my finger on it I don't think as distinctly until I was more in my 20s. Looking back it's really clear. But I had somewhere this innate, I don't know desire or thought that I had to give back, that I had to serve. And I think it came from, well, I don't think, I know, it came from now, my dad’s upbringing and sort of his background, his journey of coming to the U.S. as an immigrant and, you know, and working his way up, making a job at a place for himself in a new country after, you know, when I reflect on it, it was a hugely risky move for him to come start completely over in a new country. And I think, but the fact that that was something you could do really made me think that was those kind of values and the idea of having a country and a culture where you could do that, was worth, was worth fighting for and preserving. And so, I think that was really the reason that the military route appealed to me, of doing something where I felt like I could give back what I felt I had been given.  Host: Very cool. Give back and then also pursue that love of --  Raja Chari: Right.  Host: -- flying and engineering. So, tell me about your time in the, in the Air Force Academy.  Raja Chari: So I'd say the Air Force Academy was four-year sleep deprivation exercise, basically. The first year, as I think most people expect is a pretty intense experience, but I think what I took out of the Air Force Academy was the idea that I could pretty much do anything or survive just about anything if I just persevere and, and I, you know, I think I learned the idea of resilience is where I first got, you know, that sort of drilled into me. And looking at things as half-full. And so, yeah, it was, it was a wonderful time to look back on; while I was there it was not as pleasant. I think if you'd ask me, you know, then I would have given you a different answer and a list of a litany of complaints. But looking back on it, it sort of one of those things you realize how formative of a time that was. And glad, glad I had that experience. It's definitely colored most of my life after that.  Host: It geared you up for being a test pilot. So what was, what was that like? What do you do as a test pilot?  Raja Chari: So, as a test pilot, I think the easiest analogy I, I use the translator. And the translator is between the person doing the thing and the person who built the thing. And so, in test pilot world it's the people who built the plane and the people who are flying the plane. And so, just like if someone was going to test drive a car, they could, to test drive the car and come back and tell the dealer, like, I don't, I don't like it. Well, that's, that's not very actionable. You know, they can’t change the car based on “I don't like it.” And so, for us as test pilots we're, we're to take it to the next level, like, OK, I don't like this because when, you know, because the human factors interface is bad. And here's how you can fix it. So that's sort of our, our job is to live in both those worlds.  Host: You were not only that, you were not only a test pilot, but you were a leader as well. You were a flight test squadron commander, you a, you were a colonel. So, so what was it like, you know, taking on that role, taking on that responsibility and, and what you had to do to -- master that?  Raja Chari: I'm glad you asked. Because we talked about why did I go to the Air Force Academy, was to fly; I think why I stayed in the Air Force actually became less and less about flying and more and more about people. And so I, you know, people talk about when you're in the military, like, to strive, like you’re, you're, you're end goal should be to become a commander. And you kind of just saying that because everyone says you should do that. But I don't think I really realized until I was in it why, and it was amazing. It was exhausting physically, mentally. But it was, I mean, I think my wife would say the same thing. She was just completely exhausted by the end of that tour. Because, you know, I had the squadron and the test force to take care of; she had the spouses, the families. You know, it is a 24/7 job. And it's not just commanding, you know, the, the actual unit’s actions, but you're taking care of the people, it is a huge family. And that's why it's so rewarding, and, you know, whether it's because you're mentoring young airmen, you know, and helping them, whether it's, you know, coming up with a financial plan or, you know, dealing with sickness or injuries or their job performance, you know, it’s, it is all these things across a huge spectrum. And it's so rewarding to do but so, so exhausting. So, in the military we generally only have people be commanders for two years. And I realized about 18 months into it, like, there's a reason because you could only handle this for about two years, and then you need to just decompress for a little bit.  Host: Yeah.  Raja Chari: But it, yeah, it was a, I loved it. I would, I would do it again in heartbeat.  Host: So then what made you start considering being an astronaut?  Raja Chari: So, I think I'd always had in the back of mind being an astronaut would be a great thing to do; I don't think I thought it was really realistic until I was a test pilot and then and saw that other test pilots had gone on to become astronauts. And that's at the point I think I started really pursuing it. And then the ah-ha moment for me was when I went to do interviews in 2013 at NASA, I was blown away by the people at Johnson Space Center and just the interactions, like, the other people interviewing but also the people, we went to some of the training facilities and every place I went, I, you know, I could see myself, like, this is a place I would like to come to work, this is a, you know, a great culture, a great workforce. And then I started thinking about my time in the Air Force and, also very high-performing organization. And, but it dawned on me that the reason I liked the Air Force wasn't, I liked flying, don't get me wrong, but it was really about the people.  Host: Yeah.  Raja Chari: And that's what made me realize, oh, man I could, there's a chance to do this job. Because in the Air Force at some point I have to stop flying. You know, at some point I'm going to get too old. But you're never too old to hang out with really amazing people. And so, that really appealed to me to come to NASA, and the mission is, you know, clearly, the reason I get in the morning is to help with human exploration, solve humanity problems. It's a pretty good reason to get up and come to work.  Host: And I feel like you got, I mean, just from talking to some of your crewmates, it seems like you guys as a crew really get along together. So, in terms of that people aspect, it seems like you guys are really a good unit.  Raja Chari: Yeah, absolutely. I would, I mean obviously, I would not say don't send us to space. But would, I would also be just the fact that I get to train with these other three people and --  Host: Yeah.  Raja Chari: -- and go on, you know, go on these trips to Russia, to Hawthorne, to SpaceX, and have these experiences, that in itself is great. I mean, I would, again, I'm not saying don't launch us -- please launch us -- but if we weren't to launch in October or November, I would actually still be pretty happy about, about the year.  Host: What are you looking forward to most? When you're up in space, what's really some of things that you're really, really looking forward to?  Raja Chari: I think the things I'm most excited about are, you know, learning, basically, talking with the scientists as we're doing the research for them. And so, trying to actually understand what, you know, what is this helping with? Or what are you, you know, so, our days are packed with, essentially setting up experiments, you know, getting the results, you know, and then setting up the next one. And then we're tearing down something. And so, I think, you know, once we're actually on the loops with them, so in training we don't do a whole lot with the actual scientists because they never know exactly which ones we're going to be doing, and so that's one thing I'm looking forward to is once I'm actually on the loops -- the radio  -- when you're on the headset talking to them like, here's what I'm doing, and then have chance to talk with the them after: like, what, what is that, you know, what is that going to teach you? Or what, what's, what are the implications? And sometimes they don't even know. Like, sometimes it's you know, we don't know. We're trying this new protein and who knows what, you know, vaccine, or you know, treatment it could be used in.  Host: But that's the idea is, it's a, it's a platform to explore…  Raja Chari: Right.  Host: …all the possibilities, is microgravity the only place you could take that out of the equation, let's see what can happen.  Raja Chari: Exactly.  Host: Yeah. Very cool. You got a lot to do, Raja, so what's some of the, you said, you said got some trips coming up until actual launch, and then you've got launch day itself…  Raja Chari: Yep.  Host: …so, so what's coming up?  Raja Chari: So what we got coming up, we have two more trips to SpaceX out in Hawthorne. And out there we'll focus on crew responses to off-nominal situations. And so, out in Hawthorne they have a whole capsule simulator, so that's one of the few places we can do the physical tasks that are associated with those things, like getting the suit on in the capsule and reconfiguring it and stowing things that might be out and pressurizing the suit. All the things that might happen in the event of an emergency. We'll spend a week at the Cape doing water survival. And so that's all having to do with if the capsule came down and we had to get out early, or we came down in a place where we're not expecting to come down, how do you get out of the water, or out of the capsule into the water, set up a life raft, all that, all that kind of stuff. Also while we're down at the Cape we'll also deal with emergency egress from the pad, the launch pad, and the rocket, so if there's anything on launch day that, you know, they want us to get out of the rocket ourselves -- normally they would come unstrap us and do all that for a launch scrub, but if there's anything that it's more time critical, we have to be able to do that ourselves. So basically, dress rehearsals of all those things. And very similar to the, the military in flight test world, we don't think any of those things will happen, we hope they don't happen, but all of our training is focused on what if it does happen? Like, let's make sure we've, we've trained and prepared for all that.  Host: You got to be prepared for it. that's right. Lots to do. And I'll let you get to it. Raja Chari, thanks so much for coming out.  Raja Chari: Thanks very much. Thanks for having me on.  Host: Next is NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn, pilot of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and second in command for the mission. He's responsible for spacecraft systems and performance. On board station he'll serve as an Expedition 66 flight engineer until he takes over as command[er] of the International Space Station. Marshburn is a Statesville, North Carolina native who became an astronaut in 2004. Prior to serving in the astronaut corps, the medical doctor served as flight surgeon at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, and later became medical operations lead for the International Space Station. The Crew-3 mission will be his third visit to the space station, and his second-long duration mission, and the Crew Dragon will be the third spacecraft for Marshburn to fly in after the space shuttle and the Russian Soyuz. He previously served as a crew member of STS-127 in 2009, and Expeditions 34 and 35, which concluded in 2013. A great guy to talk to. So, here's Tom Marshburn.   Host: Tom Marshburn, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Tom Marshburn: Thanks for having me.  Host: Hey, launch is right around the corner. How are you feeling?  Tom Marshburn: Oh, feeling ready to go. I think we all feel ready to launch tomorrow, but we know there's some buffing around the edges we still need to do. And so, we're, we're excited to finish up the next couple months. It feels like it's we're going to launch tomorrow. And this times going to go by fast.  Host: What do you have left to do in this next couple of months to gear up for launch?  Tom Marshburn: We have a few more training sessions. You know, the training ramps up to where we're finally at the stage where we as a crew train together, and not just myself and the commander. And so, we are learning our choreography, our communication skills amongst the whole crew, but also wrapping in mission control both at SpaceX and at Houston for the launch and landing portions of the flight.  Host: OK.  Tom Marshburn: So we're, that's still to come. We'll, we'll have a couple of NBL runs, or Neutral Buoyancy Lab spacewalk training runs. And then a whole slew of things, last minute touches on certain things that are require up to date motor skills, up to date knowledge.  Host: Try to squeeze in as much as possible…  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: …before that flight.  Tom Marshburn: Everybody wants to get a piece of the crew before, for good reasons say, don't forget X, practice this one more time.  Host: That's right. That's right. I want to get to know a little bit more about you with this, with this time that we have. So I want to start with some of your, some of your early life. We got, we just got off the camera talking about some of the same stuff, but growing up in, it was North Carolina, right?  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: And being an outdoorsy kind of person and…  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: …your inspiration for, for space?  Tom Marshburn: So, small town North Carolina. Significantly, the last of seven kids; had a lot of people to look up to. A lot of things that, examples that I wanted to follow or not follow. And, you know, everybody growing up as teenagers and such.  Host: Yeah.  Tom Marshburn: But, had a farm in north Georgia that we're, we had a chance to really explore and go off into the woods, and live outdoors for a while. And that really translated into a love of, of the outside. I became a backpacker and a climber, and, which was just a, just a first step in the whole idea of putting a human being out into a, an austere and maybe dangerous place. So space and learning about space became the most exciting aspect of that that I could imagine.  Host: And so, the way that you decided to pursue that love of space was through physics. Why physics?  Tom Marshburn: Physics, for me, was the most basic science. It was the science that explained it all. Everything else seemed to build up from physics. So, I loved asking those deep, sometimes philosophical questions, and that was why I fell in love with it.  Host: But then, so you started pursuing that in college; your, your bachelor's, I believe, and your master's were in physics. And then at some point you make the switch to medicine.  Tom Marshburn: Yeah, I switched to medicine when I found out that, after spending enough time in the laboratories and engineering, engineering work, that I was missing more contact with people.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: I really enjoyed talking to people, getting to know them better. I had friends that were medical students; of course, my family was familiar with medicine, so it was not as such a strange idea to go off into medicine. But I figured that maybe was where my best skills were, what I could be best at. And so, I applied to medical school, got in, and made the transition from this purely analytical world to understanding the human being. And that was a fascinating switch.  Host: But that love of space never went away. And at some point, you were able to merge the two worlds: you got into, into medicine, and then next thing you know, you're working at NASA.  Tom Marshburn: Yeah. The space interest went dormant for a while.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: Medicine is so intense that you really have to put all your brain and all of your time and your body into it. But after I'd finished my training, I was in practice in Seattle, I got a letter from a former colleague who said, hey, I just heard NASA has this new training program for turning outside doctors into flight surgeons, to take care of astronauts and pilots. And I thought well, you know, I used to be interested in space; I keep thinking about how I can get into it…this seems like a perfect open door. So, I had to apply, but I got into the first class of the Space Medicine Fellowship at NASA.  Host: Very cool. So, from there, you worked at NASA, you got to learn from a lot of cool people, travel to a lot of cool places as a flight surgeon. At some point you were thinking, hey I could actually be an astronaut. When did that come up?  Tom Marshburn: My desire to become an astronaut kind of grew during that time. The opportunity arose as soon as I got here. And people said hey, you're a doc, why don't you apply? So I applied and I did not get in. And so, over the years, there was three more applications, but my fascination with space, my desire to work with these people that at that moment were my colleagues and patients, but to work with them in space, grew quite a bit. And so, after my fourth application I got in.  Host: Finally. Yes.  Tom Marshburn: Yes.  Host: And then you got to, you know, through a lot of training, you got to experience a flight from the shuttle, STS-127. So, tell me about that.  Tom Marshburn: Right. So, five years after we were selected, I finally got a chance to fly. The mission was very, very intense: 16 days, 11 days docked to the, docked to the space station, most of that time doing robotic operations; five EVAs (extravehicular activity). I mean, something was going on all the time. It was just a sprint. We were busy all the time. Even if you had time to sleep it was hard to sleep because your mind was buzzing with what you had to do and the work that had been done. And of course, it was my first spacewalk, and then I had two more after that, which certainly, kind of wraps up your whole brain. It's hard to think about anything right before or right after a spacewalk other than getting that done.  Host: Especially with a, with a flight that's just so jammed packed with activities. You have to do the spacewalk and then you got to go onto the next thing, right?  Tom Marshburn: Right. As a matter of fact, it all stacked on top of each other also. If we hit a stopping place and we couldn't continue on, we only had a few days to solve it because the other spacewalks had to happen in order to get the work done before we came home. So, it was very intense. The ground team was working like crazy; if we ran into a problem, some bolt was stuck or some…  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: …object we had in our hands we couldn't fit in the right place, we had to come up with an answer right away.  Host: Now that was different from your long-duration mission. A lot of people compare it instead of the sprint they call it a marathon. Now what was, what was that? This is Expedition 34/35.  Tom Marshburn: Right. Right. Went up there; space station has been growing in its capability to do science, and it was in this, this really exciting phase of some experiments with fluids and material science. And I was a guinea pig as well to where we were, we were, had a fairly punishing schedule. By the end of the work week we were tired. And occasionally working on the weekends. And the station has continued to grow since then. Didn't have a spacewalk planned but at the very end we had an emergency spacewalk that we had to perform, it was only three days before I was supposed to come home. So that was a great surprise that, that had happened, and surprised that they were going to allow us, right before we came home, to get that job done and do that spacewalk.  Host: And so, you're going to be returning for another long-duration mission.  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: Now that one was, was the Soyuz. This time you're going on the SpaceX Dragon. So how have you been gearing up for this mission?  Tom Marshburn: Just like for the other missions, getting ready for spaceflight, I think humans kind of know how to get somebody ready. You do some academics, you get in the simulator early, you start working with your immediate crew, and then you build the team as you get closer to launch. There are certain motor skills you got to know like in spacewalking, keep that up, there's some science experiments that require motor skills that we have maintain; robotics operations, how to fly that Canadarm so that you can grab satellites that, your cargo satellites out of, out of space and dock them to the station. So you're keeping all those skills going while you're also learning what science is going to be there so you can operate on a day-to-day basis effectively.  Host: Now you have three rookie crew members that are flying with you. And I say rookie, but just talking to you recently, they're all just super-sharp people and they're all very skilled but you're the only person that has that experience that can share that knowledge of what it's like to fly in space. So, how have you been doing that with your crewmates?  Tom Marshburn: So, making sure they understand at each stage of flight what our, our limitations might be.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: What challenges that we might have from a physiologic standpoint, what it's going to feel like? What it's going to feel like to live there? What are their expectations for what they think they're going to get done? And I want to make sure they can get everything done that they want, but I'll be there to help, certainly; I know how I'm going to react, my body’s going to react, when I get to zero g. I know what my limitations are going to be. And so hopefully, I can help them if we have any gaps that need to be filled once we get up there. But also, helping the crew, I, we're all very good at this anyway, but helping them make sure the crew has, that we have a good culture.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: That we are, number one, that we're safe. No question everybody's going to want to get the job done. But I want to make sure everybody has a good time too.  Host: Absolutely. And it sounds like you're going to. You have a pretty, pretty good crew with you. And it sounds like you guys get along.  Tom Marshburn: Yeah, we do. And that's one of the values of training together. Not just in the simulator, not just during the workday, but getting out together, having dinner together…  Host: Yeah.  Tom Marshburn: …that's absolutely essential to get to know each other.  Host: Very cool. Well, Tom, I wish you the best on your upcoming mission. Godspeed. Thanks for coming on.  Tom Marshburn: Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate it.  Host: Next, we have NASA astronaut Kayla Barron, a mission specialist for Crew-3. As a mission specialist she will work closely with the commander and the pilot to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight. Once aboard the station she'll become a flight engineer for Expedition 66 for her first trip to space. Barron was born in Pocatello, Idaho, but considers Richland, Washington her hometown. She earned a bachelor's degree in systems engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 2010, and a master's degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Cambridge in England in 2011 as Gates Cambridge Scholar. Lieutenant Commander Barron earned her submarine warfare officer qualification and deployed three times while serving aboard the USS Maine. At the time of her selection as an astronaut candidate in 2017, she was serving as the flag aide to the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy. What an incredible person to talk to, and seemingly always full of energy. Here's Kayla Barron.  Host: Kayla Barron, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Kayla Barron: Thanks for having me.  Host: Hey, launch is right around the corner. How are you feeling?  Kayla Barron: Good. I mean it is coming up really quick. I think for me as a --  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: -- rookie it doesn't always feel totally real. You know, we've been in training since I got selected in 2017, and we do a lot of awesome simulated training. And it's easy to forget sometimes that like, I'm going to be on the top of a rocket in a couple months going to space. So I think it kind of hits me in waves where I'll have this moment, you know, like the first time I touched our capsule at SpaceX. Or certain moments in training where it just hits me in this really emotional moment, like, oh I'm going, it's real, I'm doing this thing.  Host: I am going. Yeah.  Kayla Barron: And then it kind of fades back into this, like, I don't know is this real life? Sort of, pinch me attitude.  Host: [Laughter] Well I want to, I want to understand how you got to this moment. How you became an astronaut to, to go on this mission, on the SpaceX Dragon to go to the International Space Station, conduct all kinds of great science. We're going back to your childhood, and your early interest. I want to start with your interest in going into the military. I think it's an awesome story of how, you know, you could have pursued a lot of different things, but there was that moment that inspired you that says a military career is something that I want to do.  Kayla Barron: Yeah, I mean it was something I started thinking about from a pretty young age. I think about twelve or thirteen I first started, you know, having an awareness of what it meant to serve in the military. I have some extended family in the military. I lived near the Air Force Academy during the part of my childhood when I lived in Colorado. And that was kind of something in the back of my mind that I was thinking about maybe going forward. And then at the beginning of my eighth-grade year, I was 14 years old, 9/11 happened. And that was just like this hugely eye-opening moment for me at a super-developmental time in my life. You know, just starting to understand how the world works, how complicated, how scary it can be. And that really traumatic moment got my attention. But then as I watched our country come together to respond to that super-tragic event, and really unite behind what it means to be an American, for me cemented my desire to want to serve. You know, I wanted to continue my education. I was interested in engineering. But I also was interested in how to challenge myself to develop as a leader, how to be a good person, how to support the people around me. And I was thinking about, you know, what can I do with my life that will have the biggest impact? How can I make the world a better place? And for me it felt like the military was the right place to start that journey. And that's how I ended up at the Naval Academy.  Host: So, what were the things you were doing at the Naval Academy, first couple, you know, years? What were you doing?  Kayla Barron: Yeah, you know, at the Naval Academy we kind of have this three-part mission. The moral, mental and physical. So, the moral mission, it's all about developing yourself as a person, a leader, a teammate. You know, being person of integrity, making the right decision even when nobody's watching. Working as a team. Developing your leadership skills. The mental part for me, I decided to study engineering. So I studied systems engineering, which at the Naval Academy is control systems and robotics, a really integrated view of engineering, and got a lot of awesome experience in the classroom and in the laboratories there. And then the physical mission. I got to run cross country and track at the Naval Academy, and my teammates were really the core of my social group. And I got to learn how to push myself beyond my limits; you know, the, you think you're capable of running a certain time in a certain race, and then you find out like how to push those challenging moments and beyond into new capabilities. And so, those sort of major things combined helped me prepare myself to serve in the military after graduation.  Host: That was, that's perfect. Because then you, you had all these skills. I wonder at what point though you started thinking, you know, I'd like to, I'd like to pursue going into a submarine. When, when did that start coming up?  Kayla Barron: Pretty quickly after I got there. When I first showed up I, I knew for sure I wanted to be a naval aviator. I wanted to be a fighter pilot.  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: And the cool thing about the Naval Academy is officers from every single part of the Navy serve there, and we also get a chance to experience those communities during our summer training. And so pretty quickly I found myself drawn to submarine warfare officers as mentors. I just really connected with the way they saw the world. They’re are nerds, funny, you know, kind of sarcastic. And it just seemed like a good fit from that standpoint. But what really cemented it was my chance to go underway on a submarine during summer training. We actually got to go, go out, submerge, kind of do a day’s worth of operations, and I was so impressed by the sailors in the submarine force. You know, the Naval Academy, you're going to be commissioned as a junior officer, a junior leader in the military. And the people you're leading are the enlisted sailors or Marines in the Navy. And these sailors were so smart, so intrinsically motivated, they really cared about what they were doing. And I could tell that they held the junior officers to a really high standard, but also, on the other hand, were willing to invest in shaping those junior officers into the kinds of leaders they'd be willing to follow. And so it just seemed like a super-challenging operational environment to operate a reactor or drive a submarine, with this really complicated equipment, really complicated team, but also, a really supportive team to help me develop along the way.  Host: It seems like that people aspect is something that's super-important to you. And like it, it seems like you, you have a lot of passion for you know, the, the Naval Academy taught you a lot of good skills about systems engineering, you pursued nuclear engineering, you learned a lot. But it seems like that people aspect, just being with the right people surrounded by smart, driven people is something that's pretty important to you.  Kayla Barron: Yeah. I mean I think that's always been the core of where of where I found myself. Whether that was in athletics growing up, in my studies…  Host: Uh-huh.  Kayla Barron: …my family, the people I surrounded myself with. I -- I'm always looking for ways to improve and become a better version of myself, because I want to figure out how to make my career, my life, my relationships count. I want to leave the world better than I found I found it. I want to serve. And so, to figure out how to do that I think you need to be around a supportive team who's going to push you, challenge you, call you out when you make mistakes or have done something wrong, and also help you learn how to be better. And so, for me, I get the most energy from being on an awesome team. And I love working in a nerdy engineering operational environments, if I can with those teams. But for me, the people come first.  Host: I loved your story. We were talking a little bit earlier about, you know, when you went, when you started thinking about becoming a NASA astronaut and you're surrounded, you know, in the interview process, you're surrounded by all --  Kayla Barron: Uh-huh.  Host: -- these super smart people, right? This --  Kayla Barron: Yeah.  Host: -- and you said you had this, this feeling of imposter syndrome. Like --  Kayla Barron: Uh-huh.  Host: -- what am I doing here? But I wonder, you know, if you can a little, share that experience one, but then also if you got that same sense that you're talking about of being in this nerdy, you know, environment…  Kayla Barron: Uh-huh.  Host: …and, and, and you can, you know, call this place home.  Kayla Barron: Yeah. You know, I think when I first showed up for interviews, I really felt that imposter syndrome, like, like you mentioned. You just meet the other candidates.  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: And they're so smart, so accomplished. They've done all these amazing things. Been on all these crazy adventures. And I was just like, I don't, what am I doing here, you know? The, even the idea of applying to be astronaut was pretty new idea to me, so I hadn't had a lot of time to internalize all of the details of what it took to be astronaut, what it took to get selected. And so, I was kind of just like jumping in straight into the deep end. And for me the, meeting those other candidates, I was like, wow, I don't know, they might have called me by mistake; I don't know if I'm supposed to be here right now. But it also instilled sort like a healthy fatalism sort of. Like --  Host: Hmm.  Kayla Barron: -- you know, I'm just going to be myself. I don't know exactly what they saw on my application, why they were interested in meeting me. But if I try to be authentic, genuine, share who I am, good and bad. You know, if the committee of all of these fantastic accomplished people around NASA, in astronaut and outside the astronaut office, think I'll be a good fit, they're probably right; and if they think I'm a bad fit or I'm not ready yet, they're probably right about that, too. So, I kind of took a deep breath and just decided to be myself. But now that I'm here, to your point, it's just a group of super like-minded people.  Host: Hmm.  Kayla Barron: Everyone at NASA, it's just such an inspiring place to work. Everyone cares about the mission. Everyone cares about each other. And everyone cares up -- cares about showing up to be the best version of themselves, to put themselves behind that mission, to improve every single day. And so it's impossible to come here and not be inspired by the people around you. Like even if you're having a sort of a bad day driving into work, maybe you missed your coffee or whatever, you show up and the energy is palpable. Like you feel it and you want to show up for your team. So, it's a great group of people to work with.  Host: And you, you got the astronaut job, you went through the training, and now you get a new set of great people. And that is your, your crew. What are looking forward to doing with your, with this crew, Crew-3, on the space station? Tell me a little bit about them.  Kayla Barron: I'm really excited to work with the other people on Crew-3. Like, I was so pumped when I found out I was going to be a part of that team because it's just an incredible group of people with very different experiences and perspectives that I think are really complimentary. You know, Raja [Chari], he's an Air Force test pilot. He has a ton of leadership experience in the Air Force, and really brings an awesome operational perspective but a really amazing disposition as a person, a teammate and a leader as well. He's great at giving and taking feedback, he brings out the best in everyone around him and incorporates everybody, really utilizes the skills and perspectives of everyone on our team. Tom [Marshburn], he is one of the most experienced astronauts we have at NASA. He's flown to space on the space shuttle, on the Soyuz to the space station, and now he's flying on Dragon. So, he has years and years of experience and he's worked with a ton of people across NASA and across our office, has a lot of unique perspectives. And he also just is an incredible mentor. He's really invested in sharing that experience with us. But he doesn't try to say like, oh, you have to do it this way because that's way I do it; like, he really has gotten to know us. He's a great listener, and he has a way of applying his experience in a way that will work for you. And then of course, Matthias [Maurer], our partnership with the European Space Agency: he's from Germany, he's part of our crew. And getting to know him throughout training, I really, really love working with him because he thinks differently than anyone else I've worked with at NASA. He really has a way of breaking things down to their fundamental elements: understanding, one, how things work, and two, exactly what is try, what we're trying to accomplish.  Host: Uh-huh.  Kayla Barron: And he has a way of figuring out new tools, techniques, ways of thinking about things. And so, I feel like he's really expanded my skill set as an astronaut because I've incorporated a lot of his techniques and ways of thinking into how I do things.  Host: So, what do you have left on the agenda to do with this crew to get ready for launch day?  Kayla Barron: You know, launch day is coming up pretty quick.  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: But we still have some pretty important training. We're going to head to Florida, to Kennedy Space Center, to really see what the launch pad configuration’s going to be like; how we're going to get into the vehicle, we're going to practice getting out of the capsule in the water in case we had to do that in an unsupported landing site. We have more emergency training in the Dragon and here, and for the space station in our mockups here. And then we all have a little bit of spacewalk training left, some robotics training left, and also, just getting our lives together so we can leave the planet for six months.  Host: True. A lot to do, Kayla. And I will let you get to it. Thank so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Kayla Barron: Thanks for having me.  Host: Last but not least, we have ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, who is also a mission specialist for Crew-3 working with the commander and pilot to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight. He will also become a long-duration crew member aboard the International Space Station. Maurer comes from Sankt Wendel in the German state of Saarland. Before becoming an astronaut, Maurer held a number of engineering and research roles, both in a university setting and at ESA. In 2016 Maurer spent sixteen days on an undersea mission as a part of NASA's Extreme Environment Mission Operations, or NEEMO, space analog. Like Chari and Barron, Maurer will be making his first trip to space with the Crew-3 mission. Overall a wonderful person with a fascinatingly unique perspective. Here's Matthias Maurer.  Host: Matthias Maurer, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Matthias Maurer: Well, thank you for having me.  Host: Your launch is right around the corner, Matthias. How are you feeling? You excited?  Matthias Maurer: Yeah. Yeah. Kind of, but I think the excitement will come on launch day.  Host: That's right. We are recording this pretty, pretty early. So, there's, there's still a lot of work for you to do, a lot more training that you have to accomplish. I want to get to that Matthias. Before I do, I'm going to take a step from the very beginning. I want to learn more about you. Tell me about where you were born, what you studied, some of your early life.  Matthias Maurer: Yeah. So, I born in Germany and I grew up in Germany. Did the civil service as a paramedic. And then I studied in different countries. So, France, in the U.K., in Spain. So, it was all part of an integrated European study program in material science. And that's how I discovered that traveling and learning languages and learning about different cultures, it's a real enrichment.  Host: So you a, you would describe yourself as a people person then?  Matthias Maurer: Definitely.  Host: OK. Very cool. And what's been your experiences traveling around and learning those new languages; what has it taught you that you've implemented in your life?  Matthias Maurer: Well, it's like, the main lesson learned is like they're a lot of different solutions to the same problem.  Host: Huh.  Matthias Maurer: And when you grow up in Germany, it's like, you’re kind of, it has to be done this way. And but looking back from the outside and traveling to countries like India, for example…  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: …you find that there are very unique solutions, very creative solutions to the same types of problems. So it's, it broadens the horizons, and it also helps to see the world a little bit more globally.  Host: Very interesting. So, what's, what's interesting is you're describing yourself as a people person. I wonder how that folds into some of your studies, because you went for material science. So tell me about some of the things, what interested you in materials, and what are some of the cool people that you got to meet along the way?  Matthias Maurer: Well, actually my initial interest was aerospace engineering.  Host: Oh, interesting.  Matthias Maurer: But kind of like, it's a bit longer story, but when I started studying it was at the time when the Berlin Wall came down.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And so basically, I wanted to sign up in Berlin to study aeronautics. But these were the years when everything changed. And so, basically, I was kind of, I had to choose a different type of study at least for one year. So I started material science engineering. And the guys at the university who told me like, OK, next year you may then be able to switch to aerospace engineering in Berlin. They had told me like it's all the same for the first two, three years; it's basically engineering. And, but then I discovered material science is really interesting. I didn't know anything about it. And basically, the, the origin of innovation is 70% in the material that you choose. So, well, I started it and I got so fascinated that I decided, like, OK, that's exactly what I want to study. It's probably much, much better than aerospace engineering.  Host: [Laughter] Well, you studied it a lot, right? You got a --  Matthias Maurer: Yes.  Host: -- you got a Ph.D. in materials, right?  Matthias Maurer: Yes. I studied in several countries, and I got in total three engineering diplomas, in material science, material engineering, materials technology. And also a Ph.D.  Host: Very good. You threw in a little economics in there as well, right?  Matthias Maurer: That was an add on. Because --  Host: Oh, interesting.  Matthias Maurer: -- like I was dreaming about, like, one day I want to like start my own company --  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: -- and so, when I studied in France, for example, economics is part of the studies, and I liked this aspect because in Germany when you study an engineering title you, you never get into contact with economics. But I feel like when you want to start a company, you should also know about what's important to also sell your product. So I felt like that's helpful for, to become successful as an engineer. And so, I added all the economics, that was an add on.  Host: Very good. So, I wonder where astronaut comes in. Because it seems like you were thinking about a lot of different career paths sort of along your journey; it doesn't, it's not like, I mean, a lot of the stories I hear are, I always wanted to be an astronaut…that doesn't seem to be the case for you.  Matthias Maurer: Yeah. So as a kid, I grew up in an area where we had a lot of fighter planes --  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: -- flying across Germany. So, a lot of people know Ramstein, it's the biggest American air base outside of the U.S., and so, I grew up around 50, 60 kilometers from there.  Host: Oh.  Matthias Maurer: So I watched all these people flying up in the sky. And thought like, wow, that's good fun, I want to be become a pilot when I grow up. And later on, it's like I learned how to fly a glider plane. So being always fascinated by flying and exploring the third dimension of our planet. But I also was interested in the technology. So that was why I decided to become an engineer, and to do research. And later on, I also combined my material science background with the paramedic background that I had when I developed new materials for medical applications. So I developed blood filters before becoming an astronaut. So, yeah, I was, I was interested in a lot of stuff, and I wanted to dig into the details and to learn about what is behind.  Host: OK. Well, tell me about your selection when you started applying, and then your interesting path to actually come on to ESA as an astronaut.  Matthias Maurer: Yes. So the selection started in 2008, and I remember well, I came back from work like developing my blood filters, and switched on the TV in the evening, and learned on the news, like, ESA is looking for new astronauts.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And I thought like hang on. It's like I was, I wanted to study aerospace engineering before, and I'm fascinated by flying and technology; I'm an engineer, and I love science. So combining all these facts, I felt like an astronaut today does exactly that. He works, or he or she works, with a lot of, like, technology on the brink of what is possibly, what is possible, and we do a lot of experiments in space, we work in international teams -- I love working in international teams -- and with the excitement and the adventure that you have when flying to space. So this is a very unique package. And I thought like, wow, that's finally, probably, the combination of all my interests in one job.  Host: And so, you applied.  Matthias Maurer: And that's why, that's why I applied.  Host: Very good. And it took you a while to actually get on to, to ESA, right?  Matthias Maurer: Oh, yeah. The selection took one year.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: And after one year, from the eight and a half thousand Europeans that applied…  Host: Wow.  Matthias Maurer: …only ten persons passed all exams, all tests, and were considered to be suitable as astronaut. But then the director general of ESA told us, guys I only have six tickets, and I need to choose four persons, four of you who will not become astronaut. And so, Matthias, you're unfortunately one of them.  Host: Ahh.  Matthias Maurer: But I want you to work for ESA because I think you guys are all very intelligent, very suitable persons and I want you to work for ESA. My three colleagues who were also not taken decided, no: either astronaut or nothing.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And so, they continued in their job. I was the only one who accepted his offer and started working at the European Astronaut Centre, in the beginning as crew support and Eurocom -- Eurocom is like the equivalent of a Capcom (capsule communicator).  Host: OK.  Matthias Maurer: And after two years, I changed into a more management role. I was responsible for the, the evolution of European Astronaut Centre. So that's when we started also talking to our colleagues in China, maybe to bring in China into the international community. But also developing EAC towards Moon exploration.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And so, yeah, that's a lot of cooperation with universities, with scientists, but also, people within ESA.  Host: Very cool.  Matthias Maurer: Very exciting job.  Host: Yeah. So Matthias how did you go from there to becoming an astronaut?  Matthias Maurer: Well in 2015, the International Space Station program was extended four more years. And so, the director general came back to us and said like, I got more tickets to space, and I actually could hire one more astronaut  -- are you still interested? What a question.  Host: Of course, you were. [Laughter] Now you're an explorer at heart. You got to do a lot of cool things. You're about to launch to space. So you can call yourself an astronaut. But you're also an aquanaut and a cavenaut. Can you tell me about those experiences?  Matthias Maurer: Yes. Part of the training that we are able to do is we go down into a cave, that's in ESA training; we live six days, six nights, in a cave system. We explore this cave system. It's between 10, 20 kilometers long. So much, much deeper and longer than we actually can explore in these six days. And it's a training that is aiming at exploration, but at the same time at, like, strengthening your interpersonal skills --  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: -- to discover how you are perceived by your teammates, your crewmates, as a member of the team. So you actually work your leadership skills, you work your fellowship skills, and you learn how to work with people in a challenging environment with people that speak different languages, people that have a different cultural background, and how to give feedback when things go wrong, and also, how to request help when you need help.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: So it's a very interesting training. And it also allows us access to a very hidden place, a beautiful, like, a beautiful place. These cave systems are so beautiful that you sometimes think like, wow, a master artist created this, and it's all hidden underground, and not accessible to normal people.  Host: That's right.  Matthias Maurer: The same I discovered living in the station, like on the bottom of the sea as a part of the NEEMO training.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: I was an aquanaut during 16 days. And we explored Mars, so that was the analog simulation that we ran. This station is 20 meters below the surface of the sea, and so, on the bottom of the sea we lived there, and we explore the surface, a new environment. And I remember the very first day it felt kind of awkward having my helmet on, a helmet that actually is, like, locked onto my, my head, so I cannot take it off. So, in the beginning you think like, oh, what will happen if I feel uncomfortable, if I get kind of feeling of panic. But obviously, it's a test, like if you panic in this situation, you're not suitable for space.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: And then you walk out there, and you concentrate: OK, do I fully understand all the, the, the mechanisms, the technology, what happens if, how can I do, how can I rescue myself, how can I help my colleague if he or she has a problem? The second day I went out there and, walking on the surface of Mars on the bottom of the sea, in our case, I felt like, wow, this is a completely new environment. This is so beautiful. And, and I felt like this is my new environment. I, I belong here; I'm part of this ecosystem. And all the fish that fly by, or swim by, they observe me and, and I enjoyed the beauty of this. And it was kind of a bizarre sensation, like, between the first and the second day: on the first day I was fully concentrated on myself, on being safe; on the second day I accepted being there. And it was very interesting to see that the human brain is so flexible and so fast in, in adapting to a new environment.  Host: Very good. And all, now that all the training, you do those experiences, and all the training that you've been doing so far is going to help you prepare for this mission on the Crew Dragon, Crew-3, going to the International Space Station for a long time. So can you tell me about some of your objectives there -- what are you going to be doing when you're onboard?  Matthias Maurer: Well, the, the flight to the International Space Station, I hope that it will be very straightforward. The capsule is highly automated so there's very little for us to do, actually, in a nominal situation. We have to monitor with everything goes according to the plan.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: After 24 hours we hopeful, hopefully dock to the International Space Station and start our roughly six months science program up there. I bring around 35 European experiments to the International Space Station. And counting also the American, the Canadian, the Japanese experiments, I hope to participate in roughly 100 to 150 different experiments. Some of them will be unique, only run once or twice. And some of them are continuation of what my colleagues have started several years ago. Because in life sciences you also need some statistics so we repeat like many times the same experiment. We hopefully have also the opportunity to see the station grow: we get new modules, the Russians want to bring two new modules, one of these modules carries the European robotic arm. And that's kind of, like, exciting hardware that we developed in Europe. It's similar to the Canadian robotic arm in kind of, like, performance, it’s a bit smaller, shorter. But, OK, it will not be able to, to catch capsules that are send up with resupplies. But OK, it's a European technology that we want to check out in space and see how it performs. Then we have several spacewalks that hopefully will be upcoming. And we will also see different capsules coming, we will see the Boeing capsule flying to the International Space Station, we'll see spaceflight participants coming with the Russian Soyuz capsule but also with the Dragon capsule. So lots of people, lots of experiments, and lots of excitement.  Host: And lots of excitement! Wow. There's a lot that's going to happen in your mission, that is for sure. And you get to do it with three NASA crewmates. Tell me about your, your crew. How, how are you guys all work together, and you're going to be able to do all of this together. So how do you describe yourself as a crew?  Matthias Maurer: I think we are an extremely homogenous crew.  Host: Cool.  Matthias Maurer: So we are three rookies, but “rookie” sounds like as we are beginners and actually looking at my colleagues Raja and Kayla, they are absolutely experienced operators in piloting very sophisticated planes and piloting or operating a nuclear submarine. So I, I would say anything but rookie to them. Probably I'm the only rookie. Tom Marshburn, he has been twice to space, before becoming an astronaut he worked already as a crew surgeon in the, in the spaceflight program. So he has seen a lot, a lot of different crews, astronauts, different problems. So he prepared us, he helped us to like grow together as a team.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: To be prepared for certain situations that might come. And so, I think I'm extremely happy with my crew. They are an excellent bunch of people. I enjoy every day of working with them, training with them, and I think we will have a very good time in space.  Host: Well, you're a people person. You, you love exploring new cultures and that's what, that's what's great about the International Space Station. You described all the things the Russians are doing, you have a NASA crewmates, and you're going to see people from all over the world, really, with these, with these tourists and private astronauts. More NASA astronauts. It's, it's going to be an incredible time. All because of international collaboration. You being a part of this now, and this is part of your mission, how, how do you view that, the international, the commercial cooperation, this era that you're going to be a part of right now.  Matthias Maurer: Well I'm very happy to see that our cooperation is actually growing. So, from the space agencies that started the International Space Station program, now, also, like having more and more commercial partners in there, it shows to me that we are on the correct path, on the right path. It's a space program gets more and more robust the more actors we have, and the more clever people we have, the better our technology will become, and the more hardware we have and the more exciting new destinations we can fly to. So, I'm very excited to see also the flights to the Moon upcoming --  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: -- the deep space Gateway station, like, coming to fruition. And so, we'll have exciting, exciting times ahead.  Host: What a, what a cool time to be a part of. Matthias Maurer, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. It's been awesome to talk to you.  Matthias Maurer: Thank you for having me.  [ Music]  Host: All right, that is all four crew members of Crew-3.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 68, NASA in Hollywood.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So if you're familiar with us, this is where we bring in scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information at what's going on right here at NASA.  We explore a lot of topics about human space flight and dive deep into all of these subjects.  But NASA is not just scientists and engineers.  It's full of all kinds of disciplines, and today we're talking about a unique side of NASA with some very special guests.  Today we're bringing in Bob Jacobs, Bert Ulrich, and Bill Barry.  Bob, Burt, and Bill.  I promise we didn't even plan that.  But they are some pretty important people here at NASA based at our headquarters in Washington, DC.  So Bob Jacobs is the acting associate administrator of communications.  He's essentially in charge of communications and PR for the agency.  Bert Ulrich is the multimedia liaison, film and TV collaborations.  He oversees NASA's engagement in film and television projects and is also responsible for the agency's identity including the insignia, the logo that you see whenever you think about NASA.  Bill Barry is NASA's chief historian.  He's pretty much in charge of the history department of the entire agency.   So for today's episode, I connected remotely with this power trio in Washington to talk about NASA in Hollywood.  Have you noticed how have there been so many space movies and shows lately?  A lot of times these guys are hands-on with those movies, helping to make sure that they have all the right permissions and information and to make the movie the best that it can be.  And we'll get into detail about how that work.  You may already know that the movie First Man came out in theaters recently, the movie about Neil Armstrong and the journey to the historic moon landing.  The creators and cast of that movie worked pretty closely with us here at NASA, so close that they we're actually here at the Johnson Space Center to learn about our culture and to try to make the story of the moon landing as accurate as possible.  They also visited the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  Bob Jacobs actually sat down with some of those folks from First Man, including actors and actresses Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Patrick Fugit, Lukas Haas, and Olivia Hamilton, screen writer Josh Singer and author James Hansen and director Damien Chazelle, and the family of the historic NASA astronauts including Rick and Mark Armstrong and Bonnie White Baer.   He discusses working closely with them and how their perspective changed about human spaceflight after researching this movie.  We'll play some clips during those interviews on today's episode.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Bob Jacobs, Bert Ulrich, and Bill Barry and the cast and crew of the First Man movie.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Bob, Bert, and Bill, thanks for joining me today on Houston We Have a Podcast.    Bert Ulrich: Thank you.    Bob Jacobs: No, thank you.    Bill Barry: That's great.    Bob Jacobs: Glad we're here.    Host: Very honored to be talking to all of you today.  I actually can't believe that I'm talking to all three of you at the same time.  This is a, this is pretty cool.  But this is an interesting and unique topic for the show because first of all I didn't even think about bringing all of this together, but it's so important, especially now with all the movies coming out.  And Bob, especially recently you got to speak with the cast and crew, the writers, the director even of First Man, and we're definitely going to get into that.  But before we do, I did want to start with sort of an overall approach, how we're working with Hollywood, how we're working with filmmakers just in general, and just why we're doing it in the first place.  Bob, you have the best perspective, I think, as the acting associate administrator for communications.  Why are we doing this?    Bob Jacobs: Well, I think it just provides us another avenue through which we can tell NASA's story.  I, you know, and I think Bert has the total here.  I think last year was a record year with over 145 documentaries and films?    Bert Ulrich: That's correct.  I think it's 143 documentaries, 25 feature films and 41 TV programs.    Host: Whoa!    Bob Jacobs: So they give us, you know, they just give us extra avenues through which to tell our story on top of kind of the traditional means that we have to communicate across NASA with, the website, news releases, social media, that sort of thing.    Host: So it's like a, is it a different audience, is that the idea?  It's just a different group of people to listen to this message?    Bob Jacobs: Well it may be people who normally don't receive or are kind built in to get a NASA message.    Host: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: You know, someone might go see The Martian just because of the topic and because it's Matt Damon and because it's an exciting movie but don't realize or don't necessarily follow NASA and know that we've got two rovers around Mars and we're about to put another lander on Mars.  So it just gives us access to an additional audience.    Host: Yeah, and I think it's got to be important, right, because Bert, your title is literally multimedia liaison, film, and TV collaborations.  We have a person dedicated to working on this, and it sounds like it's for a good reason.  How many-- 143, that is unbelievable in a single year.    Bert Ulrich: Yeah, I think the documentary world is really the bread and butter of how we work with that industry.    Host: Yeah.    Bert Ulrich: But features are really important too.  I mean we've had a real boon, I think, in the last couple years between The Martian, Hidden Figures, and First Man that we were all involved with.  Those films have really propelled us forward also in the eyes of the film and TV communities.    Host: So how do you choose?  How do you know which ones are the good ones to latch onto?    Bob Jacobs: You know, I think, there are two things.  Number one, I think it is subjective.  It has to do with the quality of the director, the studio, if they have a history, and there's this thing that we kind of look at each other and go, is it, you know, is it feasible fiction, you know.    Host: Hmm.    Bob Jacobs: And that's kind of, that's kind of our guiding, our guiding principle.  And if we believe that it isn't so far out there and they've got a legacy of success productions, then it's something we may decide to get involved with.    Bert Ulrich: And I think historical productions are a lot easier in some ways because we have something to hone in on and that we can actually--    Host: Yeah.    Bert Ulrich: Really concentrate and try to get it as right as we possibly can from our perspective.  Of course, there's a lot of artistic license involved as well.  But fiction is another thing.  Like with sci-fi, I think that's another area that we do get involved with but we are a little bit more careful about how we can actually hone in on those subjects, which are a little more really sci-fi fictional out there stuff.    Host: Yeah, I guess, so is it kind of that you want to, you know, if you're going to work with someone and spend the time and the resources to work with a company who is trying to make a film and tell a story to tie NASA's brand to it, ultimately the NASA brand is a powerful thing, and it's something we kind of have to keep track of, so you want that to be representative of what you want to portray NASA being.  Is that kind of the idea?    Bert Ulrich: I think somewhat.  I mean I think we don't want to be misleading to the public.    Host: Yeah.  Sure.    Bert Ulrich: So if we actually have our brand on something, it means that we're really involved.  I mean there are other movies like Life where they created their own NASA logo were we weren't involved with that picture.  But something like The Martian or Hidden Figures and First Man, of course, we were very much involved with him.  We did allow our logos to be used.    Host: And that's that historical part of things.  So, Bill, once we see this historical feature coming up, what are you doing to help out and make sure that the history is well represented?    Bill Barry: I'm usually dreading when Bert appears at my doorway.  [laughter] Because there's a lot of work involved in taking a look at the script.  But, you know, particularly with the features that we've been doing lately, the big thing is that, is that they at least have some respect for the history and that they don't go too far off the deep end.  These things are not documentaries.  They're feature films.  And we have to keep that in mind. That they're going to do some things with the timeline or facts and stuff to put their artistic spin on the story.  Hidden Figures was, for example, they were meticulous about details, but they compressed about 20-odd years of history into what appeared to be two years, particularly with the civil rights changes that happened at Langley.  That stuff started happening in 1943, not in 1961.  So is that an acceptable thing for them to do?  That's one of the things that we really sort of look at and we struggle with and Bob and Bert and I talk about that sort of stuff all the time.    Bert Ulrich: And the main thing is that these filmmakers are really receptive, I think.  When you came in, for instance, with Ted Melfi, I think we gave you the script, and you were like, do you really want me to go through this?  [laughter] And we were like, yeah, sure, that would be great.  So I think you had a call with Ted, and it ended up being a call that took many, many, many hours.    Bill Barry: Yeah, Bert came by and he goes, I sent, I gave Bert back all my comments on the script, and it was, I had commented on virtually line in the script for Hidden Figures, the first version of the script that we saw.    Host: Wow.    Bill Barry: And I sent it to Bert, and I thought, well, I'm done with that.  [laughter] And suddenly--    Bert Ulrich: Yeah, the ship sailed.    Bill Barry: About two days later Bert shows up at my door, and he goes, Ted wants to talk to you.  And I said, really?  And he goes, yeah, he's on the phone.  Let me patch him through.  And Ted says, do you got a couple minutes?  And I go, yeah.  Four hours later, we hung up.  And then he calls back the next day.  So--    Bob Jacobs: And that happens across a lot of the films.  I know when we had a number of issues with the first draft of First Man--    Bert Ulrich: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: And we set up, was it Josh?    Bert Ulrich: Yeah, Josh Singer.    Bob Jacobs: Yeah, we set up Josh with Michael Collins, Jim Lovell, other people who had a real personal knowledge of Neil so they could kind of touch on his personality, some of which was missing through those, in those early drafts.    Bert Ulrich: And, you know, I was looking back at emails, and I think Josh was first in touch with us in December of '14.    Bill Barry: Yeah, it's been quite bit.    Bert Ulrich: It's been a long, long journey, actually for first man, and they really tried to get it right.  There were many iterations of that script, I think.    Bill Barry: Yeah, Josh, Josh really knew his stuff.  I mean he was, you know, was asking me questions that, you know, it took a bit of research on my part for it, and he largely already knew the answers to.  But the thing that I don't think he really got was the whole test pilot personality about how they can compartmentalize, and so earlier versions of the script sort of had Neil being, coming up as very cold in a way, and that really wasn't his personality.  It was just that he, like all test pilots--    Bert Ulrich: He was focused.    Bill Barry: He was focused and was able to compartmentalize.  And I think the final version of the movie does a much better job of showing, you know, the rounder parts of Neil Armstrong's personality, not just the, you know, the sort of, you know, test pilot adaptation to dealing with stress.    Host: So that's a hard thing to sort of, to sort of, I don't know, capture, to capture that sort of personality.  So what are we doing on our end, and like are you going through old footage and transcripts and everything to really capture or, I don't know, interviews about Neil's personality?  How are we capturing this personality trait in history?    Bob Jacobs: Well this one was unique in that all three of us had a relationship with Neil--    Bert Ulrich: Yeah.    Host: That's helps.    Bob Jacobs: That dated back decades--    Bert Ulrich: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: --in some instances.  So, you know, so we had an idea going in, and I think that each of us felt a responsibility, not necessarily to protect him, but there's not a lot of content out there about Neil.  So those of us who knew him wanted to make sure that those personality elements were reflected, and then of course where our experience falls short, there are still people out there who knew Neil from those early days, and that's why we set him up with people like Jim Lovell and Mike Collins.    Host: That's one of those artistic elements that you were talking about, how to balance the history with the art that needs to be, that needs to be a part of the story telling, but, you know, how do you decide, what's, what do, what do you want to explore in an artistic fashion and what needs to be represented as history?    Bill Barry: Well, ultimately that's, you know, the writer, the director, and the production team are the ones deciding.    Host: I see, yeah.    Bill Barry: You know, what their vision of the film is and clearly with First Man, they wanted to tell a story that's different from the typical story about the Apollo program, you know, and more get into, you know, the life of Neil Armstrong and how we, you know, dealt with the challenges and the program, him and his family.    Bert Ulrich: Yeah, and the other thing with that script is the first iteration we got, I think, Bob, you actually talked to Rick and Mark to sort of make sure that they knew that this picture was happening, and they were contacting them, but we wanted to make sure that the family was also involved, and they were very much involved along the journey as well.    Bob Jacobs: Yeah, that's a, and this one was tough.  I mean movies like Gravity or Interstellar or The Martian, you know, there aren't family members who are, who are alive and it's not really dealing with the historic aspects of the agency.  And for us, again, kind of feeling a little protective of Neil's legacy.  You know, we wanted to make sure that the family was on board because that could have created all sorts of problems for us, if it was something that we supported and the family didn't or if you took it the other way and it was something that the family did support and we didn't.  So, I think it was important for us to all get to a point that everyone felt good about what was being produced.    Bert Ulrich: And the amazing thing about Josh too is that he worked with, I mean I think Mike Collins looked at a script and he had other astronauts look at scripts, and they helped him as he sort of, you know, chipped away at trying to as much of a reality as he could with the film, given the constraints of a film.    Host: Yeah.  So that's the challenge, right, is understanding-- it sounds like there's a few extra steps when it comes to those historical features because, you know, fiction is one thing, and you want to represent the information accurately with a little artistic flare, but when it comes to real people in the real world, yes, they need to absolutely be involved.    Bob Jacobs: You know, and there's an interesting story with Hidden Figures that, Bill, I'll try not to tell it all so you can tell it, but it has to do with that scene where, where Catherine Johnson runs across the whites-only restrooms and, and the film has her walking across the parking lot and--    Host: Hmm.    Bill Barry: Yeah, and in reality, that actually never happened to Catherine Johnson.  She, the building that she worked in didn't have a segregated restroom most of the time.  So, but that, it actually happened to other people.  So, I think the movie is true to the history in that, you know, it deals with something that actually happened to real people, even if it didn't actually happen to Catherine Johnson.    Host: Yeah.    Bill Barry: And also those kind of compromises where, you know, typically we'll flag things like that on the script and say, hey, you know, you do realize this didn't really happen.  And usually we'll have a nice conversation with either the director or the script writer or somebody about, you know, what's this mean and is this, you know, is this within the bounds of, you know, what we consider acceptable.  And normally those conversations are very, you know, positive and productive, and we've never had a problem with somebody saying no, we insist on doing this wrong way.    Host: Yeah.    Bill Barry: And for that matter, you know, from our perspective, we also recognize it's a movie.  You know, it's not a documentary, and so it's, many people take it as fact, so we're serious about making sure it's not too far out of bounds.  But there is, there is, you know, room for some fuzz on the peach.    Bert Ulrich: And we even try in some cases in more fictional scenarios like The Martian, Jim Green, who was in charge of planetary science for NASA is now our chief scientist, he worked a lot with Ridley on that script, and that script basically had a, you know, had a dust storm on Mars, which was very violent, and it wasn't really characteristic of how it is like on Mars.  So he suggested a lightning storm, but they didn't really want to do that.  And, you know, you have to understand that there is a drama that's sort of unfolding.  You have to respect that to a certain degree too and find that balance.    Host: Yeah, and I think even Andy Weir was pretty respectful of that and understood that that was a constraint and that it was not real.  He understood the science behind it, but he did want that man versus, I guess, I don't know, elements, survival element to it.  But let's go into the nitty gritty because I think this is interesting.  You're talking about working with the filmmakers themselves mostly from sort of an advisory perspective.  You know, you give them the information is what it sounds like.  This actually didn't happen, and then you sort of work with them to actually determine how to tell that story.  Tell me how it works.  Someone submits a script, and then you start doing calls or you go out to the shoot.  How does this work?    Bert Ulrich: No, it starts off that we actually only get involved with projects which have funding and distribution in place, because we get so many requests that we have to prioritize those that will really have a guaranteed audience.  So that's the first sort of rung that people have to get through, and they usually do.  That's why we've been able to sort of, we've been very lucky, we've been able to sort of pick at really wonderful projects.  We're not able to do absolutely everything that comes our way, but we're able to do an awful lot.  So we'll first get something for a documentary, a treatment or for a picture or a script, and we'll look at those and we'll vet that, depending on the subject matter.  If it's historical, we'll bring it to Bill Barry.  Bob looks at basically everything, and if it's, if it's less, you know, something more about science or something, we'll send it over to the scientist.  And then they'll sort of look at it, and we'll go back and forth and have a discussion.  And then based on that, I guess we kind of see what they want.  You know, every project has its own life.  I mean they're all a little different, and sometimes they want to shoot on site.  Sometimes they don't.  Sometimes they just want, you know, some of our assets to use to help them build sets or costumes.  So it really runs a gamut.    Bill Barry: They all want to use the MASTIF trainer though.    Bert Ulrich: That's right.    Bill Barry: Which, which of course doesn't exist anymore, but--    Bob Jacobs: Yeah.    Host: What's that one?    Bill Barry: You know, that one with the spinning thing where they put the astronaut in the--    Bob Jacobs: The Mercury one.    Bill Barry: That's spins around on multiple axes.    Host: Oh yeah.    Bill Barry: If you've seen First Man, you'll have seen the MASTIF in action.    Bob Jacobs: And every now and then we get an opportunity to influence it--    Bert Ulrich: Yep.    Bob Jacobs: And one of those stories is Sharknado.    Bert Ulrich: Yes.  That's a good one.    Bill Barry: That's a good one.    Host: Oh.    Bob Jacobs: After, you know, because Sharknado was one of those examples, you know, now I think they're up to like Sharknado 22 or something, but when Sharknado first came out, it was one of those interesting second screen events where it was as much about the online conversation as it was about the film.  And after Sharknado 2, Bert and I got together, and it's like, oh we got to call the producers.  They've done everything except put the sharks in space.  And sure enough the producers came up with something.  And, you know, that was a case of, you know, you've got to suspend the seriousness and embrace the, you know, kind of the pop culture, fun part of what we do, and so we ended up with Sharknado 3 with David Hasselhoff as a shuttle commander as part of that.  So it's a little bit of both.  Sometimes it is those serious big projects that come in, and sometimes it's, hey let's call so and so and see what they think about space.    Bert Ulrich: Or we develop a relationship like with Michael Bay, I mean he worked with us on Armageddon and then later he came to us for Transformers 3 and then again the Transformers 5.  So we've been able to sort of nurture those relationships, and people like to come back sometimes.    Bob Jacobs: Yeah.    Host: Yeah, with prominent voices in filmmaking too. And all different voices, you know, whether it's serious, whether it's action, historical, or Sharknado, if it's funny.    Bob Jacobs: Yeah.    Host: So, yeah, no.  But how do you determine, you know, it sounds like it sort of has this sort of barrier, this front line of defense.  They come to you, and you decide whether or not you're going to pursue and then how much resources you want to put into it, whether you're going to just to and advisory or whether you're going to go out.  So how is that determined?  Is it really subjective?    Bert Ulrich: So, yeah, well it depends on what they need.  So basically if they need to shoot on site, we usually do something called a space act agreement, which is a reimbursable legal agreement.  So the government gets reimbursed for costs incurred beyond something that would like a normal media shoot for a documentary.  So we make sure that's done and those boxes are checked, and that's more bureaucratic, and the studios are used to that, going back and forth with us and our lawyers, and then we just kind of go full force.  We try to get people technical experts, like Bill Barry, or we'll give our assets.  We have really a great team of archivists that are out there being able to provide photo materials and footage and they just kind of go to town.  Now everyone is, regardless of whether we're involved or not with a production, everyone does have access to our film and footage archives, irrespective of our level of involvement.  So that's actually a nice thing to give back to tax payers.    Host: Yeah, no that's huge.  I mean I personally get a lot of those requests especially with the historical space station stuff, and I think it's important to sort of deliver that, but then there's a lot of it, especially on our side, that has not been digitized yet, you know.  Technology evolves, and we didn't start recording everything to digital up front, and it takes a lot of energy and time to digitize everything.  And that's really, that's really hard, especially with all the other stuff going on and all the other responsibilities.    Bob Jacobs: And a lot of times the studios will take that on for us, you know.    Host: Oh cool.    Bob Jacobs: I can think of any number of projects like IMAX and gosh, what other--    Bert Ulrich: Well, I mean also just recently we were working on a project for a CNN documentary--    Bill Barry: Yeah, on Apollo 11, and the folks behind that documentary have worked out an arrangement with the National Archives and with us to get as original copies as they can of some of that nondigitized material.  They're digitizing it for their film, and then they'll give it back to us in digital format for our use later.  So it's a, it works out to be a really nice exchange.    Bert Ulrich: And we've worked on over eight productions, I think, with IMAX.  They've given us footage as well to use that they've put in IMAX format.  I mean it's a wonderful sort of back and forth that we're able to sort of--  Host: Yeah, even with the resource constraints you can come up with another way to meet objectives.  IMAX wants footage, we want archive footage, and we can kind of share those resources.  That's very important to make those relationships work.  You know, and besides footage, Bert, I know like a big part of your job is representing the NASA identity, and I know that's a big part of working with feature films as well, slapping that NASA logo on different things, and even, you know, like you said, working with other features that don't use the logo for whatever reason.  So, again, how is that determined?  How does that process work?    Bert Ulrich: Again, we work, again I work with Bob on that because Bob oversees the use of the logo as well.    Host: Okay.    Bert Ulrich: I kind am the designee to sort of work it hands-on.  But basically, we determine it based on whether it's feasible, whether there, we're not too misleading with the public.  And then incidental use is also something that sometimes we're able to sort of work on.  Which means if it's on a suit or on a building, that's easier than any sort of branding use.  We usually don't allow branding use, like on the bottom of a promotional, of a promotion for something, but we do allow incidental use.    Host: Right.    Bob Jacobs: You know, another interesting story that Bert may kick me for for sharing, but with Gravity--    Bert Ulrich: Yes.    Bob Jacobs: We reached out when we heard that Gravity was being made and went all the way up to the vice president or the president of Sony.    Bert Ulrich: Yep, yep.  Yep it was the--    Bob Jacobs: And got a very nice, polite, you know, no thank you, we've got it.  And so we weren't involved in the production until the end, in post-production, and they decided that they wanted to reach out to us and have us involved.  And, of course, during the production, all the logos on the spacesuits were not the NASA insignia.    Host: Right.    Bob Jacobs: And they went back and digitized the NASA insignia once we decided that it was something that we wanted to be involved with there at the end.  So, you know, a lot of times the directors will go in thinking, yeah, we don't need your help, we've got this, and we can still get involved at the back end.    Host: And that's, that's huge, right, because you're talking about, we talked about reviewing for scripts and coming for proposals, but it sounds like there's a lengthy process here where we're even involved sometimes in the post-production process.    Bert Ulrich: Yeah. And then often in the release of something.  So--    Host: Oh wow.    Bert Ulrich: That also happens like with Interstellar, for instance, we didn't really, we weren't involved in the production itself.  Then later we did some outreach around it.  And also the other thing is, which is really quite wonderful, is a lot of actors and directors are very much interested in space exploration when they sort of go into this area, and they're often, you know there if we're interested to help us share our stories in the form of public service announcements or some social media vignettes that can go out, that sort of tell NASA's story, and that's really a wonderful opportunity also for NASA for the agency.    Bob Jacobs: Yeah, we had Andy Weir do a number of education events, not just public communications NASA's cool events, but things that were specifically targeted for middle school students and high school students, and that was a relationship that didn't exist until we got involved with the movie.  So, so Bert's hitting on a kind of an important point is that there's a lot of activity that happens even after the film is completed that gives us the opportunity to not only, you know, share the NASA is cool story about whatever the subjects are we want to discuss, but actually engage in STEM activities that are so important to, you know, kind of creating that next generation of explorer.    Host: Yeah, no, that's a, that's an interesting point, all the way through, you know, beyond reviewing the footage post production but also the communications of it.  And this is a, this is kind of an interesting line that we have to work, because Bert, you even mentioned, you know, slapping, you can't just slap the NASA insignia on, you know, anything, even especially promotions, so how do we, how do we work with, whenever we're communicating, when we're at this phase of sending the message out and getting people involved with STEM, how do we balance the line between STEM education and trying to involve new students and get them involved in NASA and in science and engineering but then also making sure we're not endorsing anything or crossing too many lines where that would be unethical on our side.    Bert Ulrich: Correct.  I think it is a fine balance.  I mean there are times when it's looking too, like it's an endorsement, then our legal office intervenes on that.  There are other times where you can actually have NASA be part of it without, you know, endorsing, because we're sharing a story, our story, in a way that's new and innovative, which is actually really good.  It's never quite easy.  The other thing that we do a lot with our logos would be on merchandise, and it's crazy the amount of merchandise requests we get to have the NASA meatball and now the NASA worm as well where we're permitting on merchandise.    Host: Oh yeah.    Bert Ulrich: And it's like, it's like a, you know, a triple whammy right now, I think.    Host: Yeah, there's a lot to it.  It's interesting to find that balance.    Bert Ulrich: Yep.    Host: How are you doing it with First Man now, how is that working?    Bert Ulrich: You mean in terms of logo use or branding or just in general?    Host: Yeah, in general, I think.    Bert Ulrich: Well we've been putting out some, I mean Bob interviewed the cast.    Host: Yeah.    Bert Ulrich: And we're doing some social media around that and putting out various vignettes on that, and just generally, we just kind of work with them in a way that's all run by legal where we're able to socialize some things, less other things.  And that's a big thing.  I mean I can't stress enough how important social media is for the agency.    Host: Yeah.    Bert Ulrich: And Bob oversees all of that too.  So I don't know if you want to talk about that, but I think we're more popular than ever, I think like over 170 million followers, and it's just crazy how we're able to get out there through social media with, you know, highlighting our great assets like our footage from missions and our photos from missions and just in general.    Bob Jacobs: No, it's interesting because we do, because of, I think, the interest in NASA overall, we can reach out to and engage pretty much with anyone.  I mean we've created conversations with not only the people who are involved in the films but people who also have, you know, even more followers than we do.  I think the last time I checked we had the 51st most popular Twitter feed.  You know, we've taken down two Kardashians [laughter], and we have two to go.  But, you know, with Justin Bieber, we Ariana Grande, with other people who have even more followers than we do, and we're able to create conversations just because they're excited to be talking with NASA, just as much as we are excited that someone who has, you know, those types of followers and aren't necessarily connect with space flight, are interested in what we do.    Host: So is that how you define success then in our communications, to involve as many people and just get people talking about space and get involved NASA?    Bob Jacobs: Yeah, that's a, that's a real tough one.  Measurement is always, is always hard, and we've got, you know, we all have the tools to see how many impressions we made or how many people we may have reached and things of that nature, but a lot of it is so intangible and immeasurable.  You know, I'll do thinks like just walk along, you know, here in DC, I'll just walk along the mall and see how many kids are wearing, you know, T-shirts with the NASA logo on it.    Bert Ulrich: Yep.    Bob Jacobs: And things that historically people may not notice.  You know, in commercials, any commercial that has something to do with high tech in the future typically has a NASA launch in it in some shape, form, or fashion.    Host: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: You know, whether it's a fast car or just something that they want to represent the future in, there's usually something NASA related to it.  I mean I really do think that we've become a part of the American fabric for lack of a better term where I think people just know that we're there and, you know, we've got a challenge to get them specific knowledge about, you know, what it is that we're doing and why we're doing it, like going to the moon and onto Mars and things of that nature.  But it is.  Measurement is hard, and I think it's one of those cases, you know, each of us probably had some event in our lives that got us excited about space.  You know, I'm old enough that I'm an Apollo kid.  So I was eight when Neil and Buzz landed on the moon.  So, you know, I think we're constantly trying to create, I know I am, in the outreach activities that we do, I'm looking for whatever that next inspiration moment is for a kid who would say, oh, gee, I saw this, and it had this impact on my life, and I wanted to do X, Y, and Z in STEM fields or specific exploration or just because, you know, they're excited to be a nerd, and they, you know, and they want to share that with other people.    Host: And I think that blends in nicely to this next part.  You're talking about this next big thing.  You talked with the cast, the writers, the directors of First Man, pretty recently.  What was that like?    Bob Jacobs: You know, it's interesting to be a part of it because there is this churn of Hollywood style reporters that you typically see at these types of events, you know, and I almost felt, well I did a few times, you know, apologized to the stars.  It's like, you know, I know this, you know, I know this isn't something that you guys really look forward to.  I really appreciate you taking the time.  But the thing that got me was that they were really, you know, I walked around with a pocketful of NASA meatball pins, you know, the logo, as we refer to it as the meatball for those who aren't aware of that, and, you know, I'd never seen actors more excited to receive a, you know, probably a 35-cent item in mass production, you know, [laughter] to get a NASA meatball pin.  And I remember handing it to Ryan Gosling.  It's like you've probably seen more of this than you want to.  He's like, no I'm always happy to get something else.  [laughter] So they were really, you know, and he had on that day a denim jacket that had a huge NASA logo on the back of it.   So it was interesting to see that everyone was really engaged.  They weren't blowing it off because, okay, I've got to sit through 25 interviews today.  You know, when we got them talking about these other things about NASA and about exploration and even about making the film, they seemed to be genuinely interested in talking about it.  And Bill, you were, you were being interviewed, so, you know, you know what the questions were like.    Bill Barry: Yeah, it's a, it's an interesting process when they do this sort of thing when they, you know, roll a movie out for the press and the media and they do a media day like that.  Lots and lots of people asking questions.  But it's a great opportunity for us to tell our side of the story.  Yeah, and the question I always get as the historian is, well, how historically accurate is the movie?  And I always have to, you know--    Host: Yeah.    Bill Barry: You know, give some sort of answer to that, you know, and my answer typically is, okay, it's not a documentary but within the bounds of telling a really good story, it's, you know, it used the facts.  And the fact that they had, you know, a great writer who paid really close attention to the facts and a director who was keen on it, actors who were committed to it, and they had this whole panoply of advisors that, you know, Bob and Bert brought into the process, you know, former astronauts and family members who could advise them about the, you know, the character of these people and what things were really like back then.  I think all of that had a huge positive impact on making the story a better story and also more accurate from our perspective.    Bob Jacobs: But it was interesting, you could imagine, if you could, there were like five or six tents out at the Kennedy Center's press site.  It's 94 degrees with humidity, with humidity about a thousand and a half percent [laughter], and they told us, it's like, oh well, you know, we'll be in air conditioned tents.    Bill Barry: Then the power went out.    Bob Jacobs: And then I get out, yeah, I get out to the first tent and I'm like, yeah, the power went out for a while, and the first thing that came to mind was a line in a movie where it's, you know, you have to fail down here so you don't fail up there.    Host: Right.    Bob Jacobs: But a, but, you know, they said, oh we have these air conditioned tents, and I got into the first tent to interview Ryan and Claire and noticed that these huge tube of AC were pointed at the actors--    Bill Barry: Not at the interviewers.    Host: Not at -- [laughter]    Bob Jacobs: The rest of us, the rest of us had nothing.  [laughter]    Bill Barry: I had one of those tubes pointed at me, Bob.  I was okay.    Bob Jacobs: And it was, it was hot.    Bert Ulrich: It was horribly hot.    Bob Jacobs: You know, and it's hard enough talking to these people without sweating, so let's just add, you know, the Florida climate on top of it, and it was just a hot, miserable time, but everyone was really good about it.    Bert Ulrich: Yeah.    Host: That's good, and you said they were excited too, right?    Bob Jacobs: Oh, absolutely.  I mean I think that, you know, Ryan and Claire, you know, they get a lot of the questions, and they get most of the attention, and they gave good answers, but I really got to the childlike enthusiasm by the time I got to, you know, the director, Damien Chazelle, Josh Singer.  You know--    Bert Ulrich: Fugit?    Bob Jacobs: Yeah Patrick--    Bert Ulrich: Then Lukas Haas.    Bob Jacobs: Lukas Haas.    Bert Ulrich: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: Those--    Host: Lukas, yeah.    Bob Jacobs: Yeah, those two were really, really excited about playing the roles and really excited about space flight.  So, but you know, everyone was just genuinely thrilled, I think, to be involved with something that was related to us.    Bert Ulrich: And what's really interesting too, because in some situations, I mean Lukas Haas was at Kennedy Space Center meeting Mike Collins, so did Corey Stoll met Buzz Aldrin there.  And it was really interesting to sort of see the fictional person and the real person together and start talking to each other.  It was a little surreal.    Bill Barry: Yeah, by the time we had this event at Kennedy Space Center for the media, we'd already had a relationship with the cast and the crew anyway.  I mean, we'd brought them down to Johnson before and out to Kennedy, and so it seemed, you know, it was nothing, and we had talked to them before, and they were really into it.  I remember we brought Ryan Gosling through the lunar curation facility place, and he was just amazed at, you know, getting to actually look at rocks.  He was hopping around in his bunny suit there with all the rest of us and nobody could kind of tell who he was, but he had a great time there, and he got to put on an actual real spacesuit and try out some of the stuff, and we walked him along the Saturn V down there at Johnson.  And he asked a lot of really good questions about things that clearly showed that he was doing his homework.    Host: Well, I am very curious to hear what they had to say.  So, you know what, why don't we bring in some of those questions, Bob, that you were asking them?  We can start with the cast.  We'll go with Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy together.  Then we have Patrick Fugit and Lukas Haas, and then we'll wrap it up with Olivia Hamilton at the end there.  So let's start with that, and we'll come back and kind of discuss what they talked about.    [sound effect]  Bob Jacobs: First off, thanks for doing this.  And easy one, did doing the movie make you change the way you think about the moon in any way?  Did you look at it one way before and afterwards you though, wow, we've been there?    Claire Foy: But wow, Ryan's been there.    Ryan Gosling: You know we didn't actually go there, right.  [laughter] I don't know if that's in the press notes, but that's, that's wrong.  Yeah, I think this movie changed the way I think about a lot of things, you know.  I realized just how little I knew about all of it and it was just, it was just an incredible experience, all the way around.    Claire Foy: I definitely look at it differently now, quite wistfully out the window.  Well I did before, but just more wistful.    Ryan Gosling: Is that what you're doing?  You're always wistfully looking out the window.    Claire Foy: Yeah, at the moon.    Ryan Gosling: Yeah.    Claire Foy: Aw.    Bob Jacobs: Our impression from the film, it was very intimate.  I mean everything was so powerful and so close.  Was it hard to turn that off after you finished a day's work?  I mean, you know, were there days that, okay, I've got to go play with puppies or something, I mean because there was so much seriousness and so much emotional intensity, pardon me, that was going on at the time?    Claire Foy: I've always wanted to play with puppies.  [laughter] All the time, good or bad days, just any chance.  I don't know, I felt like, I felt very fulfilled doing this film.  I felt like, and then I think when you go home it's easy to leave the work where the work is because I think you don't take it home with you because you're not kind of going over it for hours and hours afterwards going what did I do wrong, how can I change that?  I just felt like we'd go to work and we really got a chance to kind of explore it and investigate it, and so it felt kind of done when I left.    Ryan Gosling: Yeah, there was, also the way that the film was structured and the way that we shot that just was such a momentum to it, that there was always, you know, another challenge the next day to prepare for it.  We started with shooting just most of the interactions between the family, and then we went on to the X15 and then to the Gemini 8, and then we ended with the Apollo 13 and the moon landing, I mean Apollo 11 and the moon landing.  So it just was constantly escalating, and there was never an opportunity to really, to stop, you know.  We just, it was an incredible opportunity, but it just felt like a great responsibility.    Bob Jacobs: Is it harder to play a role of someone of a historic figure?  And of course you're just coming off The Crown, you know, the Queen is still very much around.  For Neil, you've got, you know, the family who is still there.  Is it, is it more challenging for someone who is real as opposed to a fictional character in a script or a movie?    Claire Foy: I think it comes with different challenges.  I find the challenge if I'm just playing character is to believe I'm making the right decision all the time, whereas I feel like if you're playing somebody who has lived or is alive, then you have that to go on.  But even if it's a fictional character in a book and you have that kind of background, it means at least you know what the facts are that you have to stick within, which I always—you can’t wildley, you know, give your character a limit or do something really, an odd choice.  You have to stick with kind of the reality of it.  So I quite enjoy that, I quite enjoy knowing what I can and can't do and then working within it.    Bob Jacobs: Would you go to the moon, Ryan?  Would you fly?    Ryan Gosling: No.  [laughter]    Bob Jacobs: Okay guys, that's our time.    [sound effect]  Bob Jacobs: Bob Jacobs, NASA television.  Guys, thank you for doing this.  Tell me, what did you learn about NASA that you didn't know going into the project?  Was there anything specific?  Were you space fans to being with?    Lukas Haas: I was a big space fan, but, I mean it's a tough question because I learned so much.  You know, there's a lot of specific things that I learned.  I mean I wouldn't even know where to start.  There's a lot.  There's a lot.    Patrick Fugit: Yeah, I, like I say this a lot, but like I grew up in Utah with a very sort of traditional, conventional perspective of NASA and space exploration, but coming here and going to Houston and everything really gave me a look into like how the people think and like what the program's sort of filter on, you know, problem solving, life goal achievement, that sort of thing is.  And then also with the film, it's like what it took for the people of this era to actually accomplish the feats, which is fascinating, fascinating stuff that I'd never known before.    Lukas Haas: The one thing I think that I learned is, that sort of fascinates me the most, is there, NASA's way of dissecting a problem.  You know, and sort of the thought processes, you know, as a, you know, I can't even describe it because all the things are so complicated.  But, what an amazing experience this has been.    Bob Jacobs: You were in full suit, I can't remember if you were in full suit at any time--    Patrick Fugit: Nope.    Bob Jacobs: But you were, you know, does the clothing, does the setting help you get into character or--    Patrick Fugit: Oh, absolutely.    Bob Jacobs: You know, could you do it if you were just walking around the way you are now?    Patrick Fugit: You know, the clothing was very specific and particular to the way Elliot See dressed was very sort of straight cut, you know, conventional, reserved kind of thing, and honestly the clothes, like the pants really helped me a lot.  Like I had the high-waisted, you know, pleated khakis and that sort of thing.  But you had the real cool stuff.    Lukas Haas: Yeah, all the, definitely the spacesuit stuff was, yeah, I mean you can't, you literally, you couldn't not like do it wrong if you tried because you're just, you're in it, you know, there's nothing you can do.  You're stuck in that spacesuit, but it's, it's a very weird experience.  I mean you can't, you know, you can't scratch and itch.  That's sort of the one thing that sort of stuck out for whatever reason, I would just have these itches, and they would kind of move across my body, and there's just nothing I could do about it, you know, and you can't tell anyone to itch it for you because, you know, they can't hear you.  And all you hear is the whish of the air going into your helmet.  But it's, you know, it's also really, it's cool to look back at the photos of yourself, because it's just beautiful.  I mean the helmets and the way everything reflects off the glass, and I mean it was, it was just really cool.    Bob Jacobs: But whether with NASA or, you know, the cadre of commercial companies that are coming online doing space exploration, if offered the opportunity, would you go?    Patrick Fugit: Yes.    Lukas Haas: I absolutely would.    Patrick Fugit: Yeah.    Lukas Haas: Absolutely.  In fact, I kind of hoped that, it probably will never happen, but it would be really cool, definitely.    Bob Jacobs: All right, thank you.    [sound effect]  Bob Jacobs: Did either of you learn more about NASA once you got into it than you did going in?  Obviously you had a, you know, you've had a lifetime of dealing with the agency—  Bonnie White Bear: Yes  Bob Jacobs: But you know, was there anything new? And for you?    Olivia Hamilton: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: How was space exploration for you before you got into the role?    Olivia Hamilton: I was, yeah, no, I had no idea honestly, how much it took to get to the moon and how many sacrifices and lives and money and ingenuity went into it.  And I, I loved, I loved what the movie talks about this, but I loved that every mission had the goal of kind of pushing beyond where we were at and that you have to fail in order to succeed.  You know, that was sort of in the ethos of NASA.  I found that really inspiring.    [sound effect]  Host: So, you know, it's interesting, you said, especially Patrick Fugit and Lukas Haas were so excited, but it sounds like what really changed was their perspective and appreciation for what they do.  It's almost like they took the role itself as a learning exercise.  Like, oh, I didn't really realize that NASA did that.  And it was important to understand what NASA does and how it operates in order to portray it.  Did you get a sense of that, Bob?    Bob Jacobs: Yeah, I think that, you know, one of the things, I worry sometimes that we dismiss what actors and directors and producers go through because we see them in a role, and we don't see all the homework that went into it before they actually played that role.  So it's like oh, what do they know?  They're an actor who, you know, was doing X, Y, Z. And it's clear that everyone really did their homework.  Whether they were into at the beginning or not, by the time they got to it, they were really into it because, you know, they got to see and learn so much about our history and how we got from, you know, then to now, and I think one of the things that the film captures really well is risk, and it's something that other films haven't, and they don't talk about it.  I mean it is, it is a story element, and you see it played out in the film, but there's a visual aspect that they capture in the execution of the missions that I don't think you really saw before.   I think the closest one for me probably would have been Apollo 13, just because of all the weightlessness that they shot there.  And they did that in this movie too.  But there's just something more, I don't know how to explain it, and I don't want to give too much away for people who haven't seen it, but there is a, they do address risk in a way that I think is unique to this film.    Host: And I think that risk, and maybe Bill you can speak a little bit more on this is kind of why a lot of them, especially, I was laughing real hard when I heard Ryan just say, you know, well you asked, do you want to go to the moon?  And he's like, no.  He just said outright just no.  And I think it was not because he just wasn't interested, but maybe how I interpreted it was it was more of an understanding of how much risk goes into these space flights to understand the dangers and the pressures of being an astronaut.  It's a lot to take on.    Bill Barry: And I think part of it too is also I think they developed a real appreciation for just how much work goes into, you know, a mission like this.    Host: Yeah.    Bill Barry: It's not, it's not like, you know, you get picked to be an astronaut and the next day you go climb in a space capsule and go land on the moon.  You know, it's years and years of dedication to, you know, an effort like that.  And I think that, you know particularly the cast of this movie but also other movies that were worked on have, usually come away with a real appreciation for, you know, how hard all of us at NASA work to, you know, do whatever it is that our job is, and of course, particularly that shows on the point at the end of spear where the astronauts who get to go do this.  But they also see, you know, at the working level for all the rest of us, you know, how much effort goes into it and how dedicated we are and how much we love what we do.    Bob Jacobs: I think the computer, the computer graphics got to the point around gravity that it could accurately depict what human space flight is really like in a way that engages the public.  Up until then, you know, well you saw a lot of sci-fi and a lot of space movies, but, you know, Star Trek, for example, which everyone loves, if they're not a Star Wars fan, and most of us around, yeah, most of us around here are what I call bi-sci, [laughter] where we like both, but there's a lot that's taken for granted.  You know, if you're on the star, if you're on the Enterprise, there's gravity, there's air.  Food magically appears.  They just transport themselves somewhere.  And in a way, you know, people grew up watching that just think that space flight is easy.  You know, it's so simple.  We should be flying at, you know, warp nine somewhere.  And the movies, I think, and really through the work of Bert, and I'm not just trying to pat Bert on the back here with him sitting right next to me, but it's through that kind of work where producers and writers have found that there's a way to tell a realistic space exploration story that's interesting, that can grab an audience.  And I think that's been missing up until really the past decade.    Bert Ulrich: And also we have receptive management, I mean, that wants to take on these projects, which is really, really great.  I mean we have, there's such enthusiasm around it, which is wonderful, and it's important to have that here too, which we do have.    Host: Yeah, and enthusiasm was a big part of it.  You were even talking about, you know, when you take on a big project like this, you want to make sure the history is accurate, but you also wanted to make sure the family was supporting it too, because it's a part of NASA, and people are, real people are being represented here.  And Bob, you got to actually talk to some of the family members.  How was that?    Bob Jacobs: You know, it was interesting.  And like I said, at the beginning, you know, it was important to know that Rick and Mark, Neil's sons, were supportive, and at the time their mother, Janet, was alive.  Unfortunately she passed away from cancer before the film was released, but I know Ryan had an opportunity to speak with her.  I know that was a regret of Claire's of not being able to speak with Janet before Janet died.  But, it was really interesting, as Bert pointed out, to have the actor and the person they're portraying interact, and, you know, so we have, you know, for example, the actress who is playing Ed White's wife sitting next to Ed White's daughter and kind of getting an understanding of, you know, for an actor sometimes it's the promotion of the film, but for these people it was their lives, and for her, she lost her father as part of the space program.   And yet, to listen to her talk about and be supportive of what it is that we're going to do in the future really meant a lot.  I mean you just weren't ignoring it or playing it off because it was part of Hollywood speak.  You know, you watched so much on television, and it's about who they're wearing, or all the superficial stuff of who they're dating and for us, it's very personal, because these people were real, and we just want to make sure that they get it right.  And it was, again, interesting to see the actors be so not only respectful of the characters that they were playing, but again get so interested in the topic.    Bert Ulrich: And that's the beauty of this movie too, because you see these people as human beings, and I think that the danger that happens when you see these heroes that have gone up and done these amazing feats up in space is you think they're in bronze or you think they're statues, but in reality they're human beings, and that's the beauty of this movie, I think.    Bill Barry: Yeah, yeah.  I agree.    Host: Yeah.  So let's jump ahead to those interviews.  You know, you talk with Mark and Rick Armstrong and then Bonnie White Baer.  Let's go ahead and jump to that.    [sound effect]  Bob Jacobs: What makes you guys so awesome?  [laughter] No, thanks for doing this.  You know, I had an opportunity to see the film last night the first time outside of kind of reviewing some of the scripts early on.  What was it like for you guys viewing it, kind of, I know you worked on it, but, you know, when you're actually seeing it on the screen, and you actually lived it.  What were your feelings like at that time?    Mark Armstrong: Well, Bob, I think, you know, like you, we saw very early versions of the script, and we've been involved with project for quite a while now, so the things that happened weren't so much a surprise.  I think what was surprising for me anyway was the strength of the performances and the music.  I mean those are things I did not, I couldn't anticipate, but I felt that those were just tremendous.    Bob Jacobs: Well did you, you know, look at a scene and go, wow, our couch was like that.  Or, no, Mark really didn't do that to me.    Rick Armstrong: Well, actually the living room, the El Lago living room was very much like it really was.  That was accurate.  There was a scene that I hadn't seen before, where I'm in my room with mom and I'm complaining that someone's messed up my crayons and everything like that, and although that exact scene didn't happen, that kind of scene happened all the time.    Mark Armstrong: It's true.  He was always complaining.    Rick Armstrong: I had an alarm, I put an alarm on my door to keep him out from doing that stuff.    Bob Jacobs: Was it, was it, you know, a lot of the emotion, to me the film was very intimate, it was very emotion throughout the entire thing.  Was it, was it, you know, you guys lived through that in reality.  What was it like for you?    Mark Armstrong: I think that--    Rick Armstrong: I think the first time we saw it definitely--    Mark Armstrong: Yeah.  I agree with you.  I think it is and inside sort of behind the curtain look at what was going on at that time.  And I feel very good about the way our family is portrayed and the way, you know, relationship in general are portrayed.  I think it gives a realness to the, that many people don't have.  They kind of, they have this view of sort of a glamorous view of things, and it was just, it was just people working hard trying to do their job and make the mission succeed.    Rick Armstrong: There were a number of improvised scenes at the house or in the pool or whatever that we didn't consult on really but, that I can remember anyway, but we're very like, yeah, I remember stuff like that.  I remember dad picking us up and, you know, trying to stuff us somewhere, chasing around, hide and seek in the house.  I mean that kind of stuff, you know, there was somebody putting a wallet on his head or something like that.  Yeah, we did all that kind of stuff, so they, somehow they tapped into that without, you know, us directly saying it.  And I really enjoyed seeing that.    Bob Jacobs: You know, after seeing the film and speaking with you, Rick, last night, you know, I kind of touched on the, you know, to us, you know, Neil Armstrong is this iconic character, a hero to us.  To you, it was mom and dad that you were dealing with.    Rick Armstrong: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: Was there any time that it hit you who he was that he was an iconic hero figure known worldwide.    Rick Armstrong: Really, I don't think it's ever really hit me that way.  I mean I understand that it ought to, so I can work out that yeah, it should, but I don't know that it ever has, and I'm not sure that it ever will in the way that you're describing, and you know, still working on it.    Mark Armstrong: Yeah, he was just dad at home, and we were just a, you know, we were just a normal family, and so that never changed.  That was true before.  That was true after.  That was a constant in our lives, and I think that was very intentional on the part of our parents.    Bob Jacobs: Guys, thank you.  Congratulations on the film.    Rick Armstrong: Thank you, Bob.    Mark Armstrong: Thanks Bob.    [sound effect]  Bob Jacobs: I think you guys were the hardest ones to think about how to interview because risk is a big theme in the film, and the film deals with it, I think in ways that other space movies haven't.  So I was wondering both how it impacted you when you were having to relive the tragedy over again and for you playing someone who was right next to you basically.    Olivia Hamilton: Yeah.    Bonnie White Bear: Well, I mean it certainly did bring up a lot of things and certainly tough times, but, you know, I was very, very touched and proud and happy with how this was all handled.  And I think it was something that needed to be told, you know.  And we all got there as a country, but there was a price that was paid, you know, but at the end of the day, we accomplished our mission.    Bob Jacobs: Do you still support exploration?    Bonnie White Bear: Oh, I do. Yes.    [sound effect]  Host: Yeah, you can definitely get a sense of the passion and just, you know, and they were kind of reflecting on their own lives as the film was happening, so yes, that representation is definitely important to the family.  You know, I talked with Jim Bridenstine on the podcast recently, because when he first got here, he talked about the NASA family.  And I feel like that's something that even, you know, I could definitely feel it here in Houston.  I'm sure you feel it at headquarters.  What is that?  What is the NASA family?  Do you guys feel it?    Bert Ulrich: Yeah, I think that's--    Bob Jacobs: You know, and I'll, my apologies for jumping in on that, but a, because there are two other people here, and I'll shut up, but there really is this sense of wanting to be a part of something greater than, and after the word than, it's kind of open ended.  And, you know, we're not, not to dismiss the work of any other agency or any other corporation, you know, that instills that same type of spirit, but there's something about NASA that just gets people excited.  They want to work together.  They want to achieve something that hasn't been achieved before, and it does.  I think it kind of brings everyone together, and there's a glue that holds people together like a family.    Bill Barry: Yeah, as government employees we take these annual surveys to see what we think about our jobs and consistently NASA comes out as one of the best places to work in government year after year I think largely because people love mission and people are here because they, you know, they love what we do and it excites them.  You know, not that people who work for the department of agriculture aren't interested in their jobs, but I think people come to NASA with a real appreciation for the opportunities that they have to spend taxpayer dollars doing really interesting stuff that'll make an impact on, you know, not just our current world, but the future world.  And that really, you know, at the end of the day, that really sort of I think jazzes a lot of people.  And to be able to do that with other people who feel the same way, you know, that's the family feeling, I think, and I think we all benefit from that.    Bert Ulrich: And sometimes we really feel the family, you know, feeling, the good family feeling, around anniversaries as well when everyone is gathering together, generations of people that have been at this agency that get together and there's this sort of common bond, and I think you can't take that away, and I think it's really inherent here when you work here because there is an inner passion, and it's a very special place to be.    Host: Yeah, I've, you know, I've been doing, I don't even know how many episodes of the podcast at this point, but just everyone I talk to, it's such a pleasure because when I bring them in the booth and I want to know the information really, I get to know a little bit about them, the folks I'm interviewing and the people that are behind these missions.  And I can tell you, every single one of them are very passionate about what they're doing.  And I think that's really important to kind of get across, and I think that's a good, you know, Bill, you mentioned, you know, make sure the taxpayers are getting what they want.  I think working with these, with these filmmakers and accurately portraying NASA and making sure people kind of feel a part of it and understand the culture here is so important, and working with the director, screenplay, screenplay writer Josh Singer and director Damian Chazelle, I think, was a huge part of that.  So why don't we jump ahead to that interview, Bob, and then we'll come back and talk about how telling this story is so important.    [sound effect]  Bob Jacobs: When some, when you got approached for the script, is it, you know, oh my gosh, what a wonderful opportunity or oh my God, how do I tell the story of someone so iconic?    Damien Chazelle: It was both.  Absolutely both.  You know, it started for me with reading Jim Hansen's book, First Man, about Neil and just sort of being amazed by realizing how much I didn't know.  You know, I thought I had a rough handle on Neil Armstrong as an individual and the moon landing, but reading this book, I mean there was so much about his life and about the mission itself that I just didn't know, and I was amazed to find out how difficult this mission really was, you know.  I think history has a way maybe of obfuscating some of those details, and you sort of look back 50 years hence and think, well these were superheroes, and they sort of, you know, accomplished it.  And it was almost easy for them.  And to see the sacrifice, to see the cost, to see the doubt and uncertainty and just the insane commitment to a goal that it took, I think was really inspiring.  But it made me and I think everyone involved in the film feel a tremendous responsibility.  You know, it's like these were real heroes and you want to try to do them justice.    Bob Jacobs: I was going to go there next.  It's a, you know, is there a different kind of weight between a fictional film and something that is rooted in history?    Damien Chazelle: Absolutely.  I mean this was my first time doing a movie about history that wasn't just, you know, not something I just came up with, and so I think, yeah, I felt an added responsibility for sure, and I think that was part of the reason why we tried to and we were so lucky to be able to just spend as much time as possible with people who knew the reality, people who knew Neil.  Like his sons, Rick and Mark, and his ex-wife Janet, other members of his family, colleagues of his, everyone at NASA that we could talk to.  We were lucky enough to shoot here for a little bit.  We were lucky enough to get to go to Houston a bunch and research there.  NASA really opened its doors to us in a way that was just tremendously generous of them, without which I don't think we would have been able to make the movie, because if you can't do it authentically, if you can't try to do it accurately, it felt like it wasn't worth doing it at all.    Bob Jacobs: I think the thing that struck me in watching the film was both the capture of the human elements and the human drama and the intimacy and the emotion, but at the same time, the hardware, the risk, I mean it was both this reality and special effects and reality and the human reality.    Damien Chazelle: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: I don't know if that makes sense or not but.    Damien Chazelle: Totally, yeah.  I mean that was actually kind of, in many ways the goal was, we sort of knew we had two movies in a way.  We had the movie that was on the ground, the family portrait essentially, of the Armstrongs at this incredible time in their life, and then of course we had the space movie.  We had the movie of these missions, and we wanted them to feel like the same movie, so we shot everything in the same sort of documentary style.  We were taking a lot of inspiration from documentaries of the period and archival footage, you know, that the astronauts themselves shot and the Life Magazine photography of the Armstrong and other astronaut families at that time.  You know, just a tremendous amount of resources visually that we had to just draw inspiration from.  But we wanted the audience to feel like they were there.  Whether it was in the house or in the capsule, like the audience themselves were, you know, right there in the rooms with Neil and Janet and right there in the capsule with Neil and Dave Scott or Neil and Mike and Buzz.  And so, again, to get that right, you know, took a lot of research, but we were really lucky to have collaborators, you know, of mine, the production designer Nathan Crowley and Lena Sandgren who did the camera work and Mary Zoffrey who did the costumes.   Just everyone was so on the same page about how important it was to get this right and to not just wing it, and so I think that helped a lot.    Bob Jacobs: Yes or no question.  Would you go?    Damien Chazelle: Would I go?  To space?    Bob Jacobs: Yeah would you go if offered the opportunity?    Damien Chazelle: I would love to.  My worry is that, and why I might veer towards no is that I might just be too damn afraid.    Bob Jacobs: Fair enough.  Thank you.    Damien Chazelle: Thank you.    Bob Jacobs: Thanks.  Appreciate it.    [sound effect]  Bob Jacobs: You know, the first thing that came to mind when I heard that the two of you were doing this together was how do you bridge the gap between a historian, who is capturing the facts of what had happened and a screenwriter who is trying to plug into the emotion.  How did you guys actually work it out?    James Hansen: Well we think that is such a good question that we actually talked about this on set and are publishing a book where the script is published, but then on the right-hand side of the page, the script is on the left-hand side, the right-hand side is a running conversation between Josh and I about what's over there in the script.  Because we had conversations about it all.  I mean if there's something that's going to, you know, not be 100 percent historically accurate, we wanted to go ahead and admit to it and explain to the viewer of the movie and to the reader of the book, well why did we make that decision.  You know, why did we choose, why couldn't we go with it So it really is, if you read our book, you'll be able to see kind of the exchange that we had over the course of many months to sort of work out these issues.    Josh Singer: Yeah, I would say that, you know, the good news here was that both Damian and I were pretty committed to giving a very accurate representation, both of the missions and also of the private life of, you know, of one of the more famous astronaut families there's been.  And so, you know, we were committed to working with Jim to not only, you know, take in, you know, try to take in as much of his book as we could, which is encyclopedic and incredible, but then also push beyond.  And that meant sitting with Jim, having Jim introduce us to folks, you know, whether it's Gene Matranga who is an engineer who worked with Neil on the X-15, or Mark and Rick, you know, and Janet, and June, Neil's sister.  You know, Frank Hughes, Joe Engle, Dave Scott, you know, ripped us apart in early drafts of the script, which was really helpful, you know, to say, okay, this isn't going to stand.   If we want to, if we really want to meet Neil's bar, we're going to have to up our game.  And we were very committed to that.  Again, both in the personal and in the professional.  And Jim really was our guide in terms of, you know, obviously his book is incredible, and then when we wanted to go beyond to help us reach out.    Bob Jacobs: So when you first get a project like this, especially with someone so iconic, so much written about him in history, so well known, do you look at it as, oh my God, what a great opportunity, or oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?    James Hansen: Well, you know, and you say well known in a sense he's in all the history books, but not really well known.    Josh Singer: Yeah.    James Hansen: I mean he's known as this shadowy figure coming down the ladder and saying these famous words, but really in terms of his personal story, and even a lot of things about his career, you know, from everything from naval aviation to his test pilot years, and then what happened to him afterwards.  Not really terribly well known, and so I think what was really great about the film is that they understood what was new from my book, and they knew where that needed to be enhanced, and so it was, this is a completely fresh look at Armstrong.  Even people who lived through and were alive and watched TV, they really, you know, they got PR explanations of Armstrong's career, and they got Life Magazine coverage, but they didn't, they didn't really get the authentic story of what was going on inside his personal life.  You know, the book covered that, and the movie really does a great job.    Josh Singer: Yeah, that was the amazing thing to me about reading Jim's book was how much was not known really to the wider public.  You know, yeah, I mean Jim said himself, most of his friends didn't know he had a daughter, let alone the wider public.  You know, or that he had lost his daughter shortly before he joined Project Gemini.  You know, the fact that, you know, little facts.  You know, I would talk to really, you know, NASA historians, I would talk to about, you know, mention Paul Bikle and the fact that Bickel didn't recommend Neil for Project Gemini, you know, or the astronaut program, and they'd be like, where did you get that?  Where's that from?  It's from Jim's book.  You know, but it's not widely known.  You know, and I think that there is so much about this story that is surprising, you know, in terms of the journey and how hard it was.  You know, Jim and I have talked about, I feel like there's a little bit of a metanarrative that sugarcoats everything, you know, that it seems like going to the moon was easy.   It seems like these were superheroes who did it.  Well, no, they were ordinary folks who worked very, very hard and they sacrificed greatly.  It wasn't easy at all, and frankly, to me that's much more inspiring, and it makes me think, oh, all those great things we want to try to achieve as a civilization, as a nation, you know, it makes me feel like they are more achievable as opposed to less because it makes me understand.  No, it's not that they had some magic sauce back in the '60's.  It's that they were willing to put in the work and to sacrifice, both in terms of, you know, personal sacrifice, personal cost, but also in terms of, you know, their lives.  And that's what we'll need to do if we want to, you know, achieve great things in the future.    Bob Jacobs: Gentleman.  Thank you.  Congratulations.    James Hansen: Thank you.    [sound effect]  Host: So a huge part, and Bill, you touched on this a little bit was going back and sort of working with them to flush out, you said, this is not a documentary, this is not, it's different.  It's a feature story, and they have a drama to tell.  So, you know, how do we, when we're talking about the history, where are you finding it, you know?  What sources are you pulling from to make sure that we're telling the right story?   Bill Barry: Oh, well, of course NASA's had a history program since the year after it was founded, so the history program has been around since 1959.  So we have a pretty good archive in addition to the national archives, which are collected anyway, but we have a pretty good, you know, instead of reference materials, right on site here.  And we also have the advantage of lots of people who have been working here a long time and knowing people who used to work here, so, you know, we talk to the alumni league and other, you know, former folks who, you know, worked here.  So there is no end of resources to check facts on, and we, you know, when a question comes up, you know, we go where the data is and make sure it's presented appropriately to the folks who are asking the question.    Bob Jacobs: And Bill is really, really smart.  [laughter] That helps.    Bill Barry: I've made my living on being able to remember weird and random facts that no one else really wants to know.    Host: All right.  Trivia partners secured, nice.  Thinking back, you know, especially, we listed off a couple movies, especially recently, that we've been working with.  You mentioned Interstellar.  You mentioned The Martian.  I think there's this sort of shift now, and I don't know if you guys can kind of sense the same thing, which is, which is going more towards the responsibility of accuracy and making sure that accuracy even in fiction, whether historical or a fictional piece of work is representing.  Are you guys getting a sense of that, that filmmakers and documentary writers want even more accuracy than maybe in the past?    Bob Jacobs: You know, it's interesting.  I'm seeing lines cross, and I don't mean this in a mean way for some of the documentary producers, but I see documentaries leaning more toward the salacious and hyping--    Host: Really?    Bob Jacobs: And the film industry being able to portray it more accurately without the hype, and you know, and it's all about building an audience, and again we're just really sensitive to it.  Again, we kind of use this feasible fiction idea as our guide, and we've just, you know, in the end it boils down to how successful is the project going to be, and with, you know, when one space film does well, other studios are going, hum, we can make money off that.  Let's do a space film.  And, you know, so I, you know, clearly it's a business, and the industry wants to do well, and I think we've been fortunate to benefit from the interest and from the success of some of the earlier projects.    Bill Barry: And I think that once people sort of get into it, they become, you know, trivia geeks like the rest of us.  You know, they start getting interested in it, and they want it to be as accurate as possible.  So you get set designers who want the sets to look right, and you've got, you know, costumers who, you know, do you have a picture of the clean room from, you know, X date, so we want to make sure the jacket the guys are wearing in the clean room look right and have the right logos on the back.  We get all kinds of questions like that all the time.  Sometimes the appetite for this sort of information is insatiable.    Bert Ulrich: Yeah.    Bill Barry: For Hidden Figures, fortunately for me, the director started sending me questions, and I figured out that there were other people who knew the answers more than I did, and I was able to farm them out, and the next thing you know, yeah, I'd be hearing back from the director saying, hey, thanks for pointing us on to this guy, because they pointed us on to this guy who gave us this answer about this other thing, and pretty soon I'm convinced, at least on Hidden Figures anyway, probably about a third of the people who work for NASA must answer the question for those guys because they ask all kinds of things to all kinds of people, and, you know, we gave them the data they wanted, and they ran with it.    Host: That's so, I find it fascinating that maybe the shift, like you said, with the documentary stories and the feature stories, I think that's fascinating, but just how accuracy itself, you know, you see a successful film that portrays accurate science, and other, you know, filmmakers and writers look at that as a successful project, and think, ooh, I'm going to make something like that, and then it spreads, you know.  Now you have spreading accurate information.  I think I would define that as success on NASA's part.    Bert Ulrich: You know, I think we also have a smarter audience quite frankly because there's so much documentary content that's generated from the industry because of cable television, I mean between Discovery, National Geographic, History Channel, all these channels are looking for content, and although some do cross the line, others try to tell the story as well, and I just think the public just gets smarter and smarter and gets more curious through this sort of, you know, informational exchange.  And that's actually, that's actually a really good thing, I think.    Bob Jacobs: Yeah, and there's so much material, for example, on the NASA website about, you know, historical facts, that it's really easy for people to quickly fact check something that they see in a movie.  They say, did that really happen?  And they can actually look it up and find out.    Bert Ulrich: Yeah.    Bob Jacobs: And I don't know whether that plays a positive impact or not, but I think, you know, movie producers don't want their movie being criticized for, you know, fiddling with the truth, and so it's important to them to get as many details as accurate as possible.    Bert Ulrich: And the beauty of First Man also is that it's sort of dispelling, hopefully helping to dispel the, you know, the conspiracy myth about the moon, which Bob has been fighting for many years, and we've had people that helped us out, like myth busters and others, to help sort of, I don't know if you want to talk about that, Bob, at all.    Bob Jacobs: Oh, yeah, no.  That was a, you know, and it's interesting, I've been at NASA long enough now that is see these, the pendulum swing back and forth, and here was a, I'm not going to dignify the network that aired the so-called documentary, but it challenged whether or not we actually landed on the moon, and as a conspiracy, and so we had a conversation with the executive producer of at the time Myth Busters, and said, you know, no one's really taking this on.  If you guys are interested, let us know, and they ended up doing I think it was a two-hour premiere for one of the seasons taking on whether or not we really landed on the moon and of course concluded that we did, but, you know, fast forward to 2018, I don't know how many people actually remember that broadcast.  So there are things that, you know, we constantly deal with.  We'll hammer it flat for a little while, and then it'll come back.   You know, and one of the things that I find a little sad is for example one of the other cable channels has, you know, the hidden inside NASA untold story files or, you know, something crazy like that.  And they tell this story of Apollo 10 where the spacecraft, the command module and lunar module separated and there was this weird tone, and it was, could it be aliens?  Could it be UFOs?  And people were running around trying to figure it out.  Now once we got down to it, we realized that even Mike Collins dealt with it in his, in a 1974 book, but at any rate, people were running around trying to figure it out because we were getting media inquiries, and it was like, well I'll just call.  And I picked up the phone and called Gene Cernan.  And Gene was like, well, I bet I know why you're calling, and started going ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  [laughter] You know, so he explained it to us, but, you know, we're running into a time now where we're losing those first generation of explorers, and we're not going to have them to go to anymore.   So it really is important to have people like Bill around in the work that the history offices do across the agency to capture it because, again, we're just not going to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who walked on the moon to ask them the question.  We've only got four left, who have walked on the moon, and, you know, we just have to capture their stories and continually find ways to keep those stories alive as we start leaning into what's next, so people don't forget.    Host: Yeah.  I feel like, you know, it's not, it's going to be, I would think, impossible to get everyone on board and say, yep, the moon landing totally happened, and that is a fact, and there's no questions about it.  You know, I feel like conspiracies, they're just going to be out there.  We have quite a few out there even now.  But, you know, I kind of wanted to start with this point, but I think it's a good place to end based on this conversation, is what is the purpose of communicating here at NASA?  Bob, especially from your perspective as the acting associate administrator of communications, why do we need to communicate?    Bob Jacobs: Well, I think it's based in our founding documentation where the original 1958 Space Act says that we're going to share to the widest practicable and I don't know that anyone's ever used the word practicable in a sentence before, but it's in that documentation.    Host: First time for everything.    Bob Jacobs: You know, but it's in that documentation, and it's evolved where, you know, the very essence of why NASA was created was that in the Cold War, you know, the Soviet Union had a very closed off militaristic space program that wasn't open, and NASA was founded as a civilian space agency and everything was going to be available.  And I think historically we've done that, from our triumphs and our tragedies.  We're very public.  And I think that's our role, is to help facilitate that story and to help present it to the public, and whether it's through the factual information that we do through our news releases and our scientific and technical findings and our missions or whether it's through movies and documentaries and toys where Lego is doing a series or collector figures where American Girl did a Hispanic explorer who wants to go to Mars one day.   I mean they all play a role in helping share what it is that the agency does.  And to me, again, it's more than just sending a space craft to go land on a point on another planet, you know.  It kind of gets to addressing some of those fundamental issues of humanity.  You know, are we alone?  Where did we come from?  And where are we going?  You know, is this survival of the species or is this something that we do just because it's interesting and fun and that's what great nations do.  So, again, that's kind of a long-winded answer, but it gets to I think the crux of why it is that we communicate, and that is to share the story of our future and where we're going.    Host: I think that is a beautiful summary.  Bob, Bert, and Bill, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.  I really appreciate you time, especially all three of you together, and Bob, special thanks to you for interviewing the guests for First Man and then actually bringing it here on the show and we can actually have a discussion around.  This was fascinating, so thank you again.    Bert Ulrich: Thank you.    Bill Barry: Thanks Gary.    Bob Jacobs: No, we appreciate it.  Thanks for having us.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Bob Jacobs, Bill Ulrich, and Bill Barry, and the cast and crew of the movie, First Man.  So we appreciate them coming on.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 101, \"Lesser Known Stories of Apollo 11.\" I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. If you're familiar with us, this is where we bringing scientists, engineers, astronauts, historians, all to let you know the coolest stuff about what's going on right here at NASA. And sometimes we take a moment to reflect on what we've done in the past. Chances are you, at the very least, know the highlights of Apollo 11--  Neil Armstrong: Houston, Tranquility Base here. The eagle has landed.  Charlie Duke: Roger Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.  Walter Cronkite Armstrong is on the moon. Neil Armstrong, 38 year old American, standing on the surface of the moon on this July 20th, 1969.  Neil Armstrong: It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  Host: It was a harrowing journey to get there but NASA persevered and got the job done by the end of the decade. They did it-- Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin-- took the first steps on the lunar surface. You can probably look anywhere-- books, documentaries, movies, articles-- and really dive deep into that mission normally told by recognizable figures-- Armstrong and Aldrin, Mike Collins, Gene Kranz. What you might not have heard are the stories of people working on the space shuttle before the moon landing even happened, monitoring the lunar space walk from the back rooms of Mission Control. And the recovery operations after landing. The arrival of the moon rocks at the Johnson Space Center. Stories of the many others who were helping to make this mission successful but that you may not have heard before. To recount stories behind the scenes of that historic mission we're bringing in some very special guests. Returning to the podcast once again is Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, our historian here at the Johnson Space Center. She's worked on oral history projects here interviewing many people to capture the lesser known stories, so she's coming on the podcast today to talk about some of these great adventures. We also shot a video a few months ago at Rice Stadium. We had such a great turnout for this video and it turned out to be partially a reunion for the nearly 50 Apollo alumni that excitedly agreed to participate. And while we were there, we tag teamed with Rice University to film as many Apollo alumni as we could in a short amount of time for them to tell their stories and we'll share those here today. So starting with Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, here are some of the lesser known stories of Apollo 11 told 50 years after the historic landing on the moon. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Once again, you are among the elite here coming on three times so I really appreciate all of the time you've dedicated to us.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh well thank you so much for inviting me. It's an honor.  Host: And it's been 50 years now since the landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon. And of all the topics, you know we've thought about this for a while, what do we really want to explore to celebrate the Apollo 50th because NASA is doing a lot all across the agency, so what can we do here on the podcast? And I thought this was such a unique topic to explore. The lesser known stories of Apollo 11. Things that-- you might hear the recognizable story, one small step for man-- you know you might hear that a lot of times but I think this is a great medium to explore some of the other ones. So Jennifer, you've put together really a fantastic list of stories that go from even before the moon landing, through the moon landing, 'til after the-- I think we're going to end with one of, I think my favorites, after going over this so I'm really looking forward to it. I think I want to kick off though, let's talk about, you know, what do we have in store actually before we even go into that? What do we even have in store for us today?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, as you mentioned I tried to pull together some of the unknown stories of Apollo 11. We all know the Gene Kranz story, the lunar landing mission and his talk before the MOCR crew, and you know he's with them 100% whether we land or we don't, I'm with you. And we know a lot of what was going on with the crew. We don't know a lot of the stories though about the people behind the scenes and so I tried to pull together some of those stories. And also, like you mentioned, pull together a story pre-mission and then some of the things that were going on during the mission that aren't, weren't as notable but today I think are quite interesting. They're sort of human stories that I think people will engage with. And then the post flight, what was going on like in the LRL and the mobile quarantine facility.  Host: That's awesome. Yeah so some of these names you're going to be hearing today are names you may have never heard before. I do think though you do have one name that I'm pretty familiar with, Michael Collins.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. [laughs]  Host: [Laughs] Of course he was the one, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, we always say those names right up front because they were the ones that had the boots on the moon, but someone had to be in the command module up orbiting the moon. And guess who that was? It was Michael Collins.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: So what did-- let's see, he might have a little lesser known story I suppose.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know he does, and it's something, I was flipping through \"Carrying the Fire\" which is his autobiography, and I was just looking for stories and I came across a poem that his wife wrote to him before his mission. He actually took the day off before the flight which we always think the astronauts are working madly up until their mission and once they climb into the cabin they're kind of done but he decided to take the day off and he called his wife-- his wife was not there-- and had a chat with her and kept rereading her note to him and the poem that was attached to it. So I thought maybe your readers would like to hear this poem that she wrote to him.  Host: Oh that is wonderful, yes. Let's go through that poem.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Okay. So this is called \"To a Husband Who Must Seek the Stars.\"   In your eyes, the first glad token  As when first our love we proved,  So your mind to mine has spoken  Just as if you're lips had moved.   You are saying -- yes I know --  That the lure of space beguiles.  You are pleading, “Let me go,”  Not unwilling but with smiles.   Can you love me, and still choose  Whispers that I cannot hear?  Late to love, how can I bear to lose? Content for some inconstant sphere?   Tell me how you see my role- To stay, to wait, yet yearn to go.  Where is the comfort for my soul?  You, my love, have helped me know.   I'll be unafraid, undaunted.  Yes of course! I need not face Any peril; or be haunted By the hazards you embrace.   I could've sought by wit or wile  Your bright dream to dim. And yet  If I'd swayed you with a smile My reward would be regret.   So, for once, you shall not hear  Of the tears unbidden, welling;  Or the nighttime stabs of fear.  These, this time, are not for telling.   Take my silence though intended;  Fill it with the joy you feel.  Take my courage, now pretended-- You my love will make it real.   And he wrote in his book, I hope I will.  Host: Wow. So that was, I guess it was her way of saying you know you need to do this mission, don't worry about me. You know I'm not going to stop you. This is kind of your destiny almost.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah and to me it's, she's also telling him while she might be scared she's not going to share those feelings with him.  Host: Yes.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: She wants him to have this opportunity. She doesn't want him to have any regrets or herself to have any regrets.  Host: But she was open with that emotion to him even-- because you said this was even before his mission.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It was.  Host: She said know that I am scared but it's not going to stop you, it's not going to stop me from stopping you. And even if I did, I would regret it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: Wow. What a beautiful way to say that. And you said that Michael Collins was on the phone with her reading back her poem to him on the phone?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well no I think he was rereading it in crew quarters.  Host: He was rereading it in crew quarters?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah and--  Host: I see.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know he mentioned how clearly she had been thinking about this for some time. It wasn't just a note, you know, kind of I love you, good luck on the mission. Clearly she had thought about this for some time and been working on it.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: What all did Michael Collins do on his day off before his mission, do you know?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, what else he did, I don't know. [laughs] He just mentioned that which I thought was interesting.  Host: He just-- yeah. That was probably one of the more significant things. If you're going to remember anything, that's a beautiful thing to remember.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: All right Jennifer, I'm really excited to go into these stories. To sort of kick things off though these stories are from something that your office does and the Oral History Project. Tell me a little bit about that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so we have a major oral history project at our center. We're sort of the lead center for oral histories across the agency. And our project was established by Center Director George Abbey in 1996. And if you're interested in more of the history you can actually go out and read an interview with Duane Ross who sort of helped kick off the project. But I'll give you a little bit of history. Mr. Abbey was a big fan of Stephen Ambrose. He wrote a number of books that were quite popular in the 90's like \"D-Day\". He wrote about Lewis and Clark and some other folks. And so he was a big fan of his efforts at interviewing these veterans and he realized that we were losing a lot of folks here at JSC who took part in the Apollo Program, Mercury, Gemini, and he wanted to capture those experiences. He wanted to capture the procedures and processes but also the events and the career experiences of some of these individuals or lessons learned. And so that project kicked off in 1997. The first interview was with Jack Kinzler who we'll be talking a little bit about today as well, and you know he was well known at the center for being a Mr. Fix It and saving Skylab, and but he was our first in the summer of 1997. Since then we have interviewed 982 people.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: We have over 2,000 recorded hours of oral history. We've done over 1,200 sessions and we have over 1,000 transcripts online.  Host: Whew! It's got to be difficult to remember all those stories. That's why you've got to capture them, right? [Laughs]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes, exactly. And everybody's got a story.  Host: Yeah, and they span-- this is not just Apollo history right? They span through the-- is it the agency's history? Is it Johnson Space Center's history?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well we actually do a lot of different oral history projects. So interesting that you mention that. We do our JSC Oral History project and it does span from the Space Task Group days through International Space Station, Orion. We've tried to capture all of that history and everything in between. But we do do oral histories for NASA headquarters. So we do interviews with administrators or center directors, people that our headquarters history office wants us to talk to. And then we've done different projects over the years that we've received funding for. Like for instance when the shuttle was retiring we did a big project to capture the history of the space shuttle from development through retirement which was a huge effort. Can you imagine, you know, 40 years of history--  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: in oral histories?  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: 30 years of shuttle but you're talking about development stage right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah and there's a lot of years there.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah there's a lot going on. So we've got that. We've captured some history of aviatrix. Let's see, we've captured a lot of women's history with the Herstory's project. So there's quite a bit out there if people want to go out to the JSC history portal and look at the oral histories, there's just so much material out there. It's such a wealth of material from these people that we've interviewed.  Host: Very exciting. And today we're going to be focusing on mainly the time around Apollo. And I think when we were going through these stories together, I think you kicked it off in such a nice way because the first thing we're actually going to talk about is the space shuttle which a lot of people don't even recognize was a thing around the time of Apollo 11. So this one was with Jerry Ross and Kathy Sullivan.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Jerry Ross, he's very well known for the number of space flights that he flew on. He's actually the record holder of seven space flights along with Franklin Chang-Diaz. And Kathy Sullivan was one of the first six women astronauts selected 1978 and she's the first American woman to do a space walk. So, you know, very well known folks. I picked these stories because I just thought they were interesting. I thought it was important to highlight the fact that there were people who were going to be working in the program later in life who were witnessing and remembered these and shared these memories with us. So Jerry Ross, he remembers, he was in college at that point. Since fourth grade he wanted to be an engineer and go to Purdue. And so this was summer break and he was working for U.S. Steel. And he remembers just sitting on his couch with his fiancée on his lap just waiting for that first spacewalk to happen on the moon, and being very excited about it. He also remembers his younger sister taking snapshots of the television. And you know it was pretty grainy, kind of hard to see, and he kept telling her you know those shots aren't going to turn out but they ended up turning out. But he was just, you know, mesmerized, he said by the whole mission itself. His fiancée found him just sort of sitting there watching, you know, endless footage of Mission Control and what was happening. And then Kathy Sullivan I think is sort of interesting because she really didn't intend initially to study science or, you know, work for NASA. She wasn't going to be an engineer. She had an interest in language and so she was actually going to study languages in college. But she remembers she was 17 at the time sitting in her family den-- you know I can kind of see her sitting on the floor the way most kids do watching TV-- and she remembers she wasn't really a spectator for this event, she was almost like a part of it she said. It just sort of drew her in and she remembers hearing Buzz Aldrin, although she admits she wasn't sure who it was at the time because she really wasn't following that closely, say contact light. And she said you know there was just this sort of spark in her mind like oh, she made a connection as to what was happening here. They had something that she called curb feelers on the lunar module so they could tell where they were on the moon. And she said it just sort of made an imprint on her that, you know, she kind of figured out some of the engineering going on there with the Apollo Program.  Host: Wow, it sounds like such a subtle thing but even these shuttle astronauts were inspired by some of the early parts of NASA history. Actually we're going through right now and interviewing some of our leaders here at the Johnson Space Center talking about, you know, how were you inspired to come here and did Apollo 11 have a significant impact, and all of them-- not all of them but a lot of them-- remember very vividly what they were doing. And a lot of them, you know, they were, a lot of them were kids so they went out and they got like some kind of moon thing that was at the grocery store or the convenience store but it was just fascinating what-- you know how much this inspired people. Now speaking of space shuttle and this is kind of what I think I alluded to in the-- before you even started with the Jerry Ross and Kathy Sullivan story, but space shuttle was a thing even before Apollo 11 landed.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. Yeah. So I was going through some of our stories and I wanted to make sure we included some women because during the Apollo Program there weren't a lot of women working or at least most of the women were secretaries and admins and we haven't had a chance to talk with them but we've interviewed Ivy Hooks and Dottie Lee and they were some engineers working in the engineering directorate. And Ivy Hooks likes to tell the story how on April 1st-- April Fool's Day 1969-- so we haven't landed on the moon yet, she gets a phone call from Max Faget's secretary and tells her to report to building 36, they're going to have a meeting there and they all thought it was kind of an April Fool's Day joke. And so they show up there and she's like what's going on? You know it's the third floor. There's a lot of furniture in this space. This space hasn't been used. It's kind of dirty, I'm wearing white. Max Faget walks in and Dottie Lee also remembers this-- she was an actual engineer trained by Max Faget-- she originally started out as a human computer out at NACA in Langley. And they both remember him pulling out of this garment bag a space shuttle, a balsa wood plane, and throwing it across the room and saying we're going to build America's next spacecraft. It's going to launch like a rocket and land like a plane. And so these two women-- they were the only two women other than the secretary-- were in this space, they were locked up. They couldn't actually tell anybody where they were or what they were working on or what they were doing, and they were helping to design the first reusable spacecraft, the space shuttle. And there weren't any windows. You know it was kind of a big deal for Ivy. [laughs] But what I find interesting about this is we're working on the next spacecraft while we're still working to land a man on the moon. And interestingly enough, Dottie Lee remembers that because she was in that room and had told herself, she had promised herself when we got back from Apollo 11 she was just going to celebrate. She was going to, you know, party like everyone else. Everyone else was so excited and she remembers she worked late that night.  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And she was in her car. And her husband also worked out here, John Lee, he was also an engineer. And she was driving home on NASA Road 1. She lived in Dickinson and she remembers seeing cars everywhere. Everyone's at the bars. Everyone's celebrating and she couldn't. She had to drive home and relieve her babysitter so it was kind of, you know, a sad moment I think for her because she had helped accomplish this goal but she had other important things to do. She had two daughters at home--  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: and but she said you know it was exciting for her though because she felt like she was contributing to tomorrow today by working on the space shuttle.  Host: That's right. And it made a significant impact. We already said, you know, like there's 30 years of the shuttle flying and even before that development stage starting in April when Max Faget pulled out a small space shuttle and said this is what we're going to do now.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Um hum. Absolutely.  Host: Who was Max Faget by the way?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Max Faget was our spacecraft designer here at the Johnson Space Center and so he helped design the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsule. So he's very well respected.  Host: A good salesman too if he's doing this--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: to get everyone to start working. That's great. [laughs]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah. And I should add that Dottie Lee actually is known for helping design the nose of the space shuttle. It's called Dottie's nose.  Host: Really?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Okay. The space shuttle, I guess, well was it the space shuttle as we know it or was it--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Really?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Wow, that's a big deal.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It is a big deal, yeah.  Host: Very busy people I'm sure all across. I know everyone was working real hard on this and that includes, you know, you said Ivy Hooks, she wanted to celebrate and was working late but she also was a mom and that was part of it, relieving the kids.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah Dottie. Dottie was.  Host: Yeah. Oh Dottie, it was Dottie that did it. Oh I'm sorry.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah that's okay. Yeah Ivy doesn't have any children that I'm aware of. [laughs] Don't worry about it.  Host: I messed that up, sorry.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: That's okay.  Host: You know now we're getting into, you know, the actual moon landing. I like this story from Bob Carlton with the stopwatch. That is a great story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah so Bob Carlton was LEM control. He's working in the mission operations control room and he's on the white team which is Gene Kranz's team. So some people might know this story but I think it's just a great human story because I think they probably know about the challenges that the flight controllers were facing in the room but there's another aspect to it that I'll talk about. So before the mission happened he was, you know they would simulate these missions, they would make sure that everything was running properly, and in his oral history he talks about the fact that they had plenty of margins in the lunar module tanks when they were going to be coming down. They were going to have plenty of fuel to land on the moon. They would have plenty of fuel left. But when they were landing Apollo 11 something happened. Neil Armstrong as he's landing the lunar module sees a huge crater where they're supposed to land and there's boulders. And so suddenly that margin that they had really starts to go down pretty quickly. And so they're watching things. He's watching it. And they weren't supposed to trip something that they called low level inside of the lunar module. They had two ways of telling how much fuel they had. They had something like a gas gauge that would tell them, you know, full, empty, and somewhere in between. And then they also had this low level sensor. And once you hit that you only had so many seconds left of fuel. Well they ended up tripping that and so Bob Carlton pulled out a stopwatch and he talks about in his oral history how he put something very technical-- he put a couple pieces of scotch tape on his stopwatch--  Host: [Laughs] Yes, very technical.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: [Laugh] Yeah, very technical. So he clicked it and he said okay when it gets to 60 seconds it'll be here and when it gets to 30 seconds it'll be here and we'll only have just a little bit of time left. The other challenge that he was facing was that you couldn't go to the moon and leave the tank empty. They had to be able to call an abort and have some fuel left. And so he said he was just watching it so intently, you know? Every-- once they got down to that low level like people were just sweating in the MOCR and it was just so quiet. And so they got to 60 seconds. And he's starting to doubt whether or not they're going to be able to land. And then they get to 30 seconds and he said finally they landed and he clicked the stopwatch. 18 seconds left of fuel.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so you know we often remember Charlie Duke telling the astronauts, you know, whew you got a bunch--  Host: You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes and you know Bob Carlton really was that guy because he knew that at some point they probably were going to have to call an abort and he wasn't really sure they were going to be able to land at this point. So what's interesting though about the story, the sort of human aspect that I think is interesting is that he sees the stopwatch and he thinks what a great memento, what a great artifact of this mission. And so he takes it back to his office and he puts it in his desk because he wants to remember this moment. And you know he pulls it out occasionally but then he realizes well, you know, I probably shouldn't keep it at work because a janitor or somebody might come in my desk and just take it.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So I'm going to take it home. So he puts it in a handkerchief and he carries it home and he puts it in a desk at home and occasionally he pulls it out. Well he pulls it out one time and he looks at it and he said, I must be losing my mind here because it should be at 18 seconds, it's at like 22 seconds, but he doesn't think anything of it he just puts it away. You know how all of us do that, we might have a trophy or a picture we'll look at it and put it away. And so he pulls it out again and it's on a different time this time. So he approaches one of his daughters who was a twirler and you know he asked her what's going on? Well it turns out she was using the stopwatch for her routines to time them and he was like oh okay that explains it. Well eventually he decided, you know, this was a great artifact, it needed to be somewhere else not in his house. So he donated it to the Smithsonian but he ended up winding the stopwatch back to 18 seconds--  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, you know, it would look like it did when they landed on the moon.  Host: Right. Right. That's where it ended up but--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: but little do people know this was used for twirling exercises.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right. Exactly. Yes. [laughs] I just think that's a great story because I think so many people can relate to that, especially with kids. You know you tell your kid don't touch this, and what does your kid want to do immediately? Touch it or--  Host: That's the only thing I want to touch now.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Exactly. Yes.  Host: Wonderful. Yeah you have-- that's a big story. You have a bunch of guys about to turn blue here because everyone was waiting. They had to-- they couldn't land in the area they were supposed to land, they had to find a new place to land which is why they were using all of these, all of this fuel. But it wasn't just those people in the primary Mission Control. You know a lot of people don't realize there are other rooms looking at other things. Even after they landed there's a room called the Mission Evaluation Room.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: Right? And there's, I like the story of Tom Sanzone monitoring the EVA. We actually got to interview him not too long ago at Rice Stadium. It was actually a weird coincidence that you have his--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh great.  Host: his name here. We have this great video where we have all these different Apollo alumni, current employees, astronauts, former astronauts and we gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary but also remember John F. Kennedy's speech in '62 there on the field. And it just turned out to be this great thing. We pulled a couple people aside. Tom Sanzone just happened to be one of them. He has a great story because he was one of the portable life support system engineers right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yeah.  Host: Yeah. So what was he doing in the MER?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so interestingly enough he was out in Pasadena originally because he was told to go home and get some rest because of course they were going to be monitoring the backpacks while they were doing an EVA on the moon. So he remembers being home, you know, sort of waiting. You know everyone was anticipating this moonwalk and the landing so he watches it at home on his television but then he's called and told to report for duty because they decided instead of a rest period the astronauts actually want to go out for a spacewalk. So, you know, he comes in and he said there were probably about eight people in the Mission Evaluation Room from Hamilton Standard which is who he works for who was in charge of that system. And you know it's kind of interesting, like I said, it's the support room for Mission Control but they're monitoring the backpacks for the astronauts. So he's monitoring Armstrong and there's another guy who's monitoring Armstrong's data as well and then they have two other engineers who are monitoring Buzz's backpack. And, you know, that backpack is really their whole life support system. Everything that we take for granted on Earth, that's what that backpack system provides. And so they're monitoring lots of different things like the amps, the batteries, the oxygen levels, the pressure of the suit, lots of different things. They actually got their data on cathode ray tubes so things would come out on TVs and they would graph that data using magic markers, by hand you know? Things that we're used to computers doing nowadays but they would do that by hand. They also had these displays with stopwatches because they wanted to make sure of course the astronauts are on the moon, the last thing you want is oh my gosh you know we have like 20 seconds left of oxygen, get in the LEM, you know?  Host: Yeah. Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You want to make sure there's ample oxygen and everything's going fine. So you're monitoring all of these things, all of these things with inside this space suit itself. And you know they are so focused on the task at hand, kind of like Bob Carlton was on that stopwatch, that Tom Sanzone doesn't even remember seeing Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon. He doesn't remember that at all and he's not even sure there was a TV in the room but they were just so focused.  Host: They were looking at the data.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm.  Host: They were-- yeah they didn't have time to look at the TV, they were looking at that stopwatch. Oh man they're going out.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah I remember talking to Tom Sanzone and the-- I think the funniest thing I learned from that is I did not realize that once the astronauts landed, the next thing was a rest period, for them to take a nap.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: And I remember Tom Sanzone when he was recalling this just laughing because he's like can you imagine, you landed on the moon and you're like hold on let me just take a quick nap.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: Of course they were excited. They wanted to go right out. So, yeah of course they weren't going to waste any time and oh let me just rest up a bit. They only had a couple hours really.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah it was about two and a half hours.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: To be out on the moon.  Host: Right so obviously yes you have to take care of that period you know I'll sleep later.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. Well and you just imagine the excitement. You're kind of like a little kid. I mean this is a new playground for you to go out and see a new world.  Host: Yes.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And experience all of that.  Host: And you know what's great is they got to feel that way, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon, yeah I'm excited, let's go out. But they had people like Tom Sanzone in the back room that was busy looking at a stopwatch and you know couldn't, yes maybe he was excited but didn't have time to go check out a TV because he had a job to do and it was, you know, folks like him that actually made that possible. So I love these small stories of people in the background. It's amazing.  Real quick while we're talking about Tom Sanzone, we actually got to interview him at Rice Stadium while we were there so here's his version of the story. [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Tom Sanzone, and what was your job during the Apollo program?  Tom Sanzone: I was a portable life support system engineer. That's the backpack that they wore on the moon so I worked for Hamilton Standard was the name of the company then. It's a United Technologies Company. So we did all the testing, modifications, maintenance, flight prep, astronaut training in vacuum chambers and things like that. So I was involved with most of that stuff.  Host: Okay. Do you have highlights from your time working in portable life support systems, something, some story that comes to mind?  Tom Sanzone: Yeah I smile because I've been asked this before and what I tell people is when I was 22 years old 10 months out of Villanova I got to train Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 crew on how to use that life support system and my career has been downhill ever since. [laughs]  Host: Do you remember where you were during the Apollo 11 moon landing?  Tom Sanzone: Yeah. For the landing I was actually in my apartment in Pasadena primarily because the crew was supposed to sleep after they landed on the moon and then go out for their walk on the moon after they woke up. So we were going to monitor the performance and so they didn't want us hanging around and, you know, being tired so none of us really believed that they were going to sleep [laughs] you know so it wasn't a surprise. So I watched by myself in my apartment in Pasadena when they actually landed and then shortly thereafter I got a phone call saying you know they're not going to sleep, they're going to go out. I-- can you imagine sleeping on the moon when you just landed? [laughs] And so then I, you know I drove in and I worked in what's called a Mission Evaluation Room, you know, one of the back rooms of Mission Control.  [ Transition Sound ]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I don't think people realize how many people were working in the background.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Just making sure everything was operating smoothly, you know? The astronauts get sort of all the credit and the attention but there were so many people that contributed to the Apollo Program in so many different ways.  Host: And this next story is a perfect example of that because this is the story of a guy who honestly didn't even appreciate the landing on the moon until much later. I love this story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Ed Fendell, he did an interview with our project years ago and he is on console also with Gene Kranz's team. He's the ENCO console. And he remembers as the landing is happening, he's kind of levitating in his chair. And he knows that he wasn't really levitating, but that's kind of, it was just so surreal. He didn't really think they were going to land on the moon the first time. He thought that maybe they would try but it wouldn't happen. But it's just so surreal he feels like he was levitating and you know they do the change of shift and he goes home. He decides to, you know, go back to his apartment, get some rest, cleans up, and decides to grab some breakfast before he heads in for work the next day. And he goes by what's called a Dutch Kettle. It's like a coffee shop and nearby his apartment and he decides to go sit at the counter. He's got a newspaper with him and he orders breakfast. Said he ordered scrambled eggs. I'm sure he got some other stuff but he was sitting there and some guys walked in from a gas station down the street and, you know, you could tell because they were in their overalls and you know they're kind of greasy, but they were talking about the Apollo 11 mission and talking about how they had been through World War II, they were at Normandy and D Day, they walked through Paris and made it to Berlin, and one of the guys said but yesterday was the proudest I've been to be an American. And Ed Fendell was sitting there and he heard that and it suddenly hit him what they had done. And he picked up his newspaper and left the restaurant and he started to cry and he just kind of lost it because until that point, you know he knew we landed on the moon but I don't think it hit him, you know like it had hit so many other Americans across the globe who were just excited. Like Dottie Lee mentioned, so many people were at the bars celebrating. People were in Times Square. But it hadn't hit this person who was in the MOCR who was so focused on getting the task done until this moment, what they had really achieved and what it meant to the citizens of this country. And he said he still has this paper til this day. You know he cried in his car and decided to come into work and but that's just such a great moment. I mean it really speaks to what was happening with some of these guys in the MOCR. It was a great achievement but it didn't really hit home initially--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: what had happened.   Host: It-- certainly that story gives me an appreciation for how focused these guys were. You know like it's not just, they're not just the front row seat for this whole thing. It's way beyond that. It's these guys that had their head buried in all of the data to make sure that the mission was going to be successful really just working hard to get the mission done and not truly realizing or appreciating the world around them and everything that was happening because you have guys looking at stopwatches, you have guys monitoring data, you have guys just making sure that after you know 18 seconds left of fuel that everything's going to run smoothly and we're going to get these guys home. You know it's not just we landed on the moon. The mission's not over at that point.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: And it's something that I think, you know even these human interest stories, these, and not even human interest but just these very human stories really, you know, help you to appreciate that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Very much. And I should add, you know, a lot of people that we've talked to over the years who were part of the Apollo Program talk about how they were so singularly focused they didn't really know what was going on with Vietnam or Civil Rights. All of these things that were erupting around the U.S. and the story that I always like to tell people is Al Bean who was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 12 said he didn't really learn about all these things until much later thanks to the Discovery Channel. And this is before he came to NASA but he said he didn't even know who Rosa Parks was. You know Rosa Parks, that was in like the 50's.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But I mean that's a good example of just how involved they were in Apollo. Their noses were very deep into these subjects and they weren't watching the news, they weren't reading the papers, they were singularly focused on achieving the goal of landing a man on the moon.  Host: Yeah. Of course there was a lot going on in '69 you know? This was definitely even to some of these guys were some of the most, one of the proudest American achievements landing on the moon but you did have Vietnam going on. I know a popular, was it a book or a movie, \"The Andromeda Strain\"?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah \"The Andromeda Strain\", the book.  Host: It was a book, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah by Michael Crichton, yeah.  Host: Yeah. So this next story about, is it John Hirasaki?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: John Hirasaki, yeah.  Host: John Hirasaki, \"The Andromeda Strain\". That's, that was interesting because that was the, almost, I don't know, \"The Andromeda Strain\" is I guess about this virus that comes to Earth or something, right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I remember reading it-- I haven't read it in a while but I remember reading it in college and thinking oh this is crazy, you know, that you would have to-- I think it was sort of based on this idea of a Lunar Receiving Lab and sort of going in and having to like burn your skin off when you would want to come out because of this bug that came to Earth and just this sort of scary environment.  Host: Yeah but it really helps you to put into perspective like that was a thing. People were very, you know, the moon, we were landing on the moon but part of the mission was getting all this stuff back and people had no idea what to expect. What is on the moon? So they were handling these things with such care because we don't know. We can get a virus and bring it back, who knows?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right. Yeah, yeah. There was a big concern. A lot of people who worked at NASA weren't as concerned because they thought the moon was a sterile environment.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So initially when we were planning for the moon landing there wasn't this idea of a Lunar Receiving Lab. That came a little bit later. You know we were really focused on engineering. But then scientists themselves who weren't working at NASA became concerned that we were going to be bringing back people and rocks and soil from the moon and, you know, what impact would that have on plants? What impact would that have on humanity and animals? Could that have a detrimental impact? And maybe we need a quarantine facility. So that started the whole discussion about whether or not the crew needed to be quarantined and for how long and the safety of the planet and all of these concerns.  Host: Yeah we've had a couple podcast episodes so far with some of the folks in the lunar lab and other folks who study meteorites and I think one of the best things from the Apollo 11 mission was when Neil Armstrong, you know they had these containers that they were supposed to put all the rocks in, but after they put the rocks there was a lot of empty space. So what does Neil Armstrong do? He starts-- he gets out the shovel and starts putting in some of the soil--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: from on top just to fill some of this empty space. You know, why not? So they're on the moon and a lot of the folks say that that was some of the best stuff that they brought back with them. Not the rocks but the soil themselves. It revealed a lot about the moon and about Earth's history.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Very cool story. So what's the story on Hirasaki?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I'm going to sort of intertwine that with Randy Stone--  Host: Oh yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: because they both worked for the landing and recovery division. They're both young guys who came in and they're both actually on the ship, the USS Hornet, which is the ship that's going to pick up the crew coming back from the moon for the first time. And so they both work for the landing and recovery division. They're both engineers. Randy Stone is the lead engineer for the folks outside of the mobile quarantine facility. And John Hirasaki is actually going to be quarantined with the crew that's coming back inside the mobile quarantine facility. And so I want to just talk a little bit about Randy Stone first because I think it kind of gives an idea of what's happening and then we can talk about John. We'll probably go back and forth between the two.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But he was on the ship for a while. You know they were practicing things. They knew that President Nixon was going to be coming on board and so they were practicing maneuvers and routines and trying to get things ready for when the crew was coming and for when the president was coming. When the president comes, he actually models the biologic isolation garment for the president which I wish I'd seen a picture of it. I haven't been able to find a photo of it. But I, you know I think that's kind of interesting that he would be working on these things. And John Hirasaki is placed on board but he's placed inside of the mobile quarantine facility. They actually drew straws. There were four guys who were interested in being in that mobile quarantine facility. Even though, you know, there were fears about maybe bringing back a lunar bug and you know nobody knew what they might be bringing back and what impact that might have. He was actually a newlywed. He had married someone about six months earlier and so of course \"The Andromeda Strain\" is on her mind. But you know people wanted to make a contribution. People were willing to say, you know, hey I'll participate. I would like to do that task. And so he got the short straw and was in the mobile quarantine facility. He was put in early because there were concerns that, you know, he might catch something from some of the crew on the Hornet and they didn't want him to have any sort of cold or virus and give that to the crew themselves. And there was another person who was in the mobile quarantine facility and that was Dr. Carpentier, their physician at that time. So like you said, you know there were some concerns that they had but he's, you know he's got a front row seat. When the crew comes back he's got a front row seat to hearing the stories that the crew would tell about landing on the moon for the first time which is really exciting of course because when you go somewhere exciting and interesting you want to come back you want to tell people all about it. And they're locked in this quarantine facility because people are concerned, hey maybe you brought back a lunar bug. Maybe you're going to infect humanity as we know it. So they've got a chance to actually sit and talk with the crew and they tell their stories. So here, we need to go back now to Randy Stone because John Hirasaki is in the mobile quarantine facility. They bring back the crew, they go into the mobile quarantine facility but they also need to bring back the command module. And inside the command module are things like the rocks, as you talked about. There are also photos that they need to get back here to Houston to process. And Hirasaki, that's going to be one of his tasks. Well, Randy Stone is in charge of sort of safing the command module and, you know, there's a lot of toxins on board and so they need to make sure that the reaction control system jets are safed. And they also need to attach the command module to the mobile quarantine facility which is a trailer essentially that they're living in. And so they sort of snap it on but then he talks about how they've got hundreds of rolls of yellow tape. He said they used to joke that they couldn't go to the moon without yellow tape. He said it's like duct tape is today. You know--  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: you just use it for everything. And so, you know, they had to seal up the command module with all this yellow tape so there would be a good seal. Even though it snapped on they wanted to make sure nothing made its way out. You know they were very concerned about that trying to protect, like I said, humanity and animals and plant life here all across the globe. Not just Americans themselves. And so once they had done that, John Hirosaki was able to go into the command module and do some of the things that he needed to do. One of the first things that he mentioned that he had to do was take photographs of the command module, the interior. This is what it looked like before anybody touched it. You know this is where the switches were. This is how things, where things were located. And so he did that and then he reaches in and he grabs the rock boxes which you mentioned, and he also grabs the magazines, the photos that the crew had taken because here in Houston they want both of those things. And then there's also a beta cloth bag of luner rocks that they're going to take with them back in the mobile quarantine facility. Interestingly enough though, he has to take those boxes and he has to vacuum seal them before he can give them to Randy Stone because Randy Stone is going to take those boxes and put them on a carrier. But they need to be decontaminated because of course they're in the command module so he vacuum seals them and then puts them in a decontamination lock which Randy Stone describes it as using a, you know, a really toxic Clorox solution because they have to be rinsed and washed. And he said that, you know, it would hurt your hands. It would stain your clothes. It smelled horrible. But you wanted to make sure of course you killed everything. So he said, you know, his most memorable moment though was getting that box-- those boxes which were made here by our tech services people-- and taking them with the Marine guard. He said he thought it was rather funny, he's on a Naval carrier but he's got Marine guards with him taking it to the plane as if anybody's going to jump on him and grab these lunar rocks. And he said that was probably his proudest moment. But then John Hirosaki remains in that mobile quarantine facility. And interesting enough, he's sort of the chef and bottle washer is what he likes to call himself. Of course they had to eat and they had something new in that mobile quarantine facility, a microwave. They had an Amana Radarange which a lot of households-- nowadays everybody has a microwave but at that point a lot of households didn't. And so he was actually in charge of picking out the kind of meals that they would have in the mobile quarantine facility when they were doing tests. People wanted them to have like fancy meals like Lobster Thermidor and other things--  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: and he was like nah, I think we need something else.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Maybe just like meat and potatoes kind of thing.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, you know, he spent a lot of time, you know, preparing meals and doing those sort of things. And obviously just chatting with the crew, learning more about the mission itself. And then once they got to the Lunar Receiving Lab here in Houston he helped do some work here and obviously he was in quarantine with the rest of the crew.  Host: Wow. So that must've been quite a long time then that he was in quarantine.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah they were in quarantine for a total of 21 days but that started from the minute that they left the lunar surface, a total of 21 days. So--  Host: Got it. Okay. Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah they wanted to be sure that, you know, they didn't have any lunar bugs that they brought back just in case.  Host: I know. Yeah you go through all these different measures to make sure you're not touching anything too much which I think blends in nicely with the next story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Terry Slezak is a photographer who is in the Lunar Receiving Lab when the crew gets back. But before the crew actually left, he had been for a time trying to figure out how they were going to safe the film, you know make sure that they could process that film, make sure it wasn't contaminated with lunar bugs. And so he'd been doing a lot of simulations in the Lunar Receiving Lab which is an awfully complicated process which I probably won't go into because I'll probably slaughter it. But you know they were trying different ways of making sure they could safely process the film but not release anything out into the public that wasn't safe. And so, you know, they tried different ways of protecting the film. They put like nylon in between the film itself. Of course you couldn't expose it to light, otherwise you would destroy the images. So they ended up using an autoclave trying to protect the film and interleaving it with a Kodak paper that they used. Well it worked fine for most of the simulations. And they would also introduce bacteria into some of the simulations because they wanted to make sure the autoclave was working and make sure that bacteria would be killed and he would try and grow bacteria on Petri dishes. Well things seemed to be working fine until like the day before they were going to bring back all that film and what happened is he got a phone call from his chief and said did you do something different to the film this time? And he said no, didn't do anything differently. And it turns out all of the film in the canisters that he brought back over had melted in the bottom. So you know they were of course were very concerned because here we are, we've spent how many billions of dollars going to the moon and you know we might actually destroy this flight film. And we might not have a record of what happened on Apollo 11. So they had to go back and figure out what happened. They had to fix the autoclave. They had to replumb it and they had to do another simulation to make sure everything worked safely this time. And then of course they brought back the rock boxes. They brought back the photos. Well that's photos-- the film, the canisters. And so Terry Slezak is working with this film and he notices there's a note from Buzz Aldrin that you know this is the most important magazine but Neil dropped it on the moon and he doesn't think anything of it. He pulls it out and there's all this black dust. And everyone around him is looking at him and he's like whoa, what is that? And he's like oh it's lunar dust.  Host: Oh my God.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And everyone of course is kind of concerned because they're like oh well, you know, that's lunar dust and we're just in plain clothes. So they take a picture of him. He's got lunar dust. If you go on our website you can actually see it so--  Host: Oh cool.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: he holds that up. He becomes known as the first man to touch lunar dust. [laughs] But then there are protocols that have to be followed. He has to take a shower. He has to clean up with lots of Clorox. But in the meantime of course being a photographer and knowing about this historic moment, he is mainly concerned about the film. You know he's not necessarily concerned about himself, but he's concerned that this material is really going to be too rough on the film, it's going to scratch it. And that we might lose the film anyways because of the lunar dust. So he's very concerned about this. But Terry Slezak is an interesting guy. You know he's in the lunar receiving lab, so in addition to taking care of the film he's doing a lot of other tasks. He used to be an army medic so he's taking the vitals of the crew like blood pressure and their temperatures and things like that. He's also showing films in the crew reception area to the folks. They actually brought in some films so they could actually have some entertainment when they didn't have anything else to do. But they were actually quite busy in there. He also was helping to safe the command module. The command module made its way back to the Lunar Receiving Lab and there were a lot of toxins in there that had to be removed. He said he went out to North American and learned how to safe the vehicle and learned a lot about the plumbing. And he was told look, I have enough to do because he was also in charge of taking photos inside the Lunar Receiving Lab. And they said oh you can just add it to your list, no big deal. He also helped clean out the command module and he said it was kind of a gross, yucky task. There were things in there that nobody would want to touch like used wash cloths, you know? When they would shave there'd be all these whiskers on there and things and they had to document everything that they took out and put it on a list. So, you know, he was quite busy. And he actually talks about what life was like in the Lunar Receiving Lab. He said it was just crazy, that people were constantly calling. They wanted to know, like what was going on. He said people would call at like 3 o'clock in the morning, hey you know we just want to know what's going on in the Lunar Receiving Lab and he's like I'm trying to sleep. [laughs] Like, what do you think is going on?  Host: He slept in the receiving lab?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So.  Host: Random people or like managers and like--?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: He said it was their secretary.  Host: Okay.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, but you know I imagine that there were a lot of people, probably the news media as well--  Host: Oh yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: you know wanting the stories. And he was taking photos. He said he would post photos of what was happening in the Lunar Receiving Lab, you know, so people could come take photos of those photos. So, you know, there was a lot happening. There was a lot of attention on these guys and this building. Even though the mission was over.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. I guess mission-- yeah the mission itself but maybe not the entirety of the mission. All the processing afterwards that happens especially the moon rocks and all. Every-- all the scientists probably wanted them too. This Terry Slezak you said?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm. Yeah.  Host: A very interesting guy. Photographer. Former medic. Technician. Movie--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Like he made it into a movie theater. Janitor. He was cleaning stuff.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: [Laughs] right.  Host: Very interesting stuff, yeah. A man with many hats. Very, very cool. There's an interesting story about the flag on Apollo 11. I think this is a very good one too.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah. So Jack Kinzler who we talked about who was our first oral history interview--  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know head of our-- chief of tech services here at JSC. Well MSC at the time. You know he was called into a committee that Bob Gilruth had in his office and they were talking about, you know, what they might do to celebrate this lunar landing. Like how can we demonstrate-- we did it. What can we do on the moon? And so the first thing that he suggested was well there needs to be a plaque. You know, something that demonstrates what happened. You know something where people can look and see, or another creature can look and see what we did. So he decided to go back and come up with some dummy plaques. And so he came up with the idea of a plaque with a flag on top of it, and sort of the astronaut's name and then he presented that to Bob Gilruth and the rest of the committee and they said oh okay, you know, we'll think about that. And they sent it up to headquarters. Headquarters worked on the wording and then they came back with-- and I wanted to make sure I got it right so I brought. “Here men from the planet Earth”-- excuse me, sorry my eyes – “set foot upon the moon July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.” Which interestingly enough I read in an interview with Tom Paine who said that originally they wanted to say we come in peace for mankind but the White House who also had a chance to review the plaque changed it to came. And they also decided to add the president's name to the bottom because originally Jack Kinzler said they weren't going to include the president because this was a NASA endeavor.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It didn't involve the White House. But they decided to go ahead and put Richard Nixon's name on there.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And you also notice on the plaque itself that there's the two hemispheres. He said that Bob Gilruth was looking at the plaque and he saw the flag and he said you know it might be more interesting actually if you put the two hemispheres there because if there's another creature that comes upon the moon, someday wants to figure out well where's Earth, you know they're not necessarily going to know where Earth is, but they could look and see this image and know oh that's the planet. That's where they came from.  Host: Ah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so he said that's where the idea originally came from. So the flag though was also something that Jack Kinzler was very interested in because he thought, you know, that would be a great way to mark the moment, to unfurl the flag on the moon. And you know you would think well that's easy, we'll just go down to Sears or Kmart and we'll just buy a flag.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And you actually couldn't do that. So they had to come up with a flagpole and they had to come up with something that could be stowed on the lunar module and so they came up with this flag. It was the three foot by five foot flag that they came up with and decided how it was going to operate. They had to test it out. They also had to make sure it would fit on the lunar module so they went out to the lunar module that they have here and made sure it would all fit, they would be able to tuck it away safely. And then he had to go down and actually train the astronauts in how to deploy the flag on the moon. So he had to go down to the Kennedy Space Center and show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin how this was all going to work. So they had to practice. And then he installed the flag on the lunar module along with the plaque before it went up to the moon. So you know a lot of people-- you probably hear a lot of conspiracy stories about how of course we didn't really go to the moon. A lot of people say well one reason is because if you look at that flag that's on the moon, it looks like it's fluttering in the wind. Well, Jack Kinzler had come up with this idea because of course they wanted you to be able to see the flag so they actually stitched a hem on this flag and they had an aluminum rod that would go through. You were actually supposed to completely stretch it out so it'd be completely straight for the photos. But the crew noticed that it would-- if was kind of fluttering, you know the way it might flutter here on Earth and so they didn't extend that aluminum rod that whole way. They decided to leave it where it looked like it was fluttering.  Host: Ah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so to this day a lot of people say well of course it's on a sound stage somewhere in Burbank or what have you, and but he had designed it that way.  Host: Wow. So it would've been-- if they'd just pulled it out just all the way it would've been a completely stiff flag which was the design of it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Right. It would've been taught, yes.  Host: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, that's one of those things but it's, yeah it's just, they didn't pull the rod out all the way.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yeah.  Host: Interesting.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Wow. That's cool. I like that. I don't know if this is a true story so I don't even know if I should tell it but it was just one of those things when because when I first started working here I started giving tours of the Apollo 11 Mission Control Room--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh yeah.  Host: which is now being restored here on Friday. So or they're going to open it up to the public on Friday. But one of the things we used to tell was that plaque that you were saying, I believe they made three of them if I'm not mistaken. The plaque that they actually put on the moon, they had a replica of it in that room and it was hanging on the wall underneath one of the flags that they brought to the moon which actually ended up being one of the Apollo 11 flags through some story that I won't tell here. But it literally said the same exact thing that you just said, we came in peace for all mankind. And the story that we always used to tell was that there were three plaques made by three different contractors and every one of those contractors wanted to know-- they were identical plaques-- they wanted to know which plaque ended up on the moon so that contractor can say my plaque, and they, and I guess no one ever told them or no one ever knew which one was which so that way they can all share credit.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: And I forget where that third one is. One's here and the other one's on the moon and I think the other one I want to say is in the Smithsonian so I can't say for sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I hadn't heard that story before.  Host: Yeah. Yeah it was one of those things that we always used to tell. It was really cool. They had like little artifacts all around the moon and I think they're going to bring them all back for the Apollo MOCR opening here soon.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh well that's great.  Host: Yeah. But it was just one of those stories. I love that story. I think this is a great story to end it all off because we started with, you know, some shuttle astronauts recalling seeing the moon landing as a kid. We went even before the moon landing to say this is when shuttle started and we went all the way through but, you know, after the astronauts landed of course you know you were saying the whole world was celebrating. And so the astronauts went around the world to celebrate with them. And it was sort of this parade. So what was this thing? What was the, this I guess parade of astronauts going all around the world?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so there was a goodwill tour that the president sent the astronauts and their wives on. And so it was a tour of 22 countries in 38 days so it was sort of this whirlwind tour.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And we have an interview with one of the secretaries who went with the crew and their wives. Geneva Barnes tells some interesting stories from that great, or \"Giant leaps\" tour and you know it was just an exhausting tour. You know they would spend a night at every location except for I think she mentioned Bankok and Rome. You know they were just constantly on the move. They had a plane. They were in the Vice President's plane, Air Force Two which they considered really their home away from home. They had meals there. They could drink the water there. They could take naps. So it was really nice for them because they were constantly on the move. Everyone just wanted a piece of the astronauts. Everybody wanted to see them. Crowds were everywhere. You know the first place that they went, Mexico City, I mean if you've ever seen the photos, I mean it's just amazing how close the crowds are to the Apollo 11 crew.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And she talks about the fact that they were so busy-- they were so jetlagged, they were constantly moving around. They weren't, you know, as you and I do when we go on travel, we're probably tired. We're not eating well. We're not sleeping well because we're not in our own beds. And she said that a lot of the embassies, the state department embassies would talk to each other when they were coming, when they were scheduled to come, and they would talk about the fact that well, you know, there have been some illnesses on the crew, you know these-- because they didn't just come with the wives and the astronauts and Geneva Barnes, there were other people that came. And they were worried that well maybe you know that quarantine period wasn't long enough because maybe the crew actually did bring back some sort of lunar germ because everyone's been getting sick and some people had flu-like symptoms. And the physician that came with them, Dr. Carpentier who was also onboard the mobile quarantine facility and in the LRO--  Host: I remember the name, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. So he had to actually go talk to the media when they were in London and explain, no the crew didn't bring back any lunar bugs, you know? They were just tired. They were just, you know, they had a hectic schedule and they were just kind of worn out which I think is, you know, kind of amusing that people would actually be concerned about that. They had already gone through a quarantine.  Host: Yeah well it was, I mean this, we've brought up this idea of a lunar bug through so many different parts of this story. You could tell it was just something that was so prominent in the world.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well you know it was a big fear.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: A big unknown at that point.  Host: An unknown, exactly.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. And we still would quarantine the crews, you know? And we still quarantined 12 and 14 just to be sure even though the Apollo 11 crew was fine. But she also tells a number of other interesting stories. She talks about for instance going to Belgrade. They met the deputy prime minister there and they invited the astronauts out for a duck shoot and they took their wives on a tour down the Danube River and they took them out for a seven course lunch and they said that they were so full. And that lasted until four or five in the afternoon and then they got word that well the chef's back at the hotel they were staying at got a hold of the ducks and they were planning this huge dinner for them. So they were, you know, stuffed already from this huge meal.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And they had to go back to the hotel and get ready for dinner and eat whatever the chefs had come up with using these ducks. They really only had one rest stop that she remembers. When they went to Rome she couldn't remember if there was an American ambassador there at the embassy at the time but they gave them the afternoon there at the embassy. So they had a chance to just really relax and be themselves and play tennis. And she mentions that they ate hamburgers and hot dogs and potato salad. I mean how much more American can you get, right? [laughter]  Host: Probably much needed after this, you know-- was that probably towards the middle of the tour too, just a break.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I think they really needed it because there were so many crowds. She talks about going to Senegal for instance in Dakar. And she said the plane landed and these crowds just rushed toward the plane. They had to turn off the jets because they were just like here come all these people, you know just tons and tons of people. They finally managed to get them out and into cars and she said that was challenging as well because, you know, they were supposed to be following each other to the hotel but she said they're-- people managed to wedge their way in between the vehicles. She said it was so scary because at one point security came back and told them to get out of their vehicle because they were taking their car for the astronaut wives. And they said find another way-- find another car-- and she was like how are we going to find another car? They managed but she said they were all kind of squished on each other, sitting on each other's laps. She said it was just so crazy. At one point the car that had the astronauts started to overheat and she said she doesn't understand the mechanics but she said she'd heard that if you want to make sure your car doesn't overheat, you turn on the heater and that sort of helps things.  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so she said they ended up taking a shortcut through a soccer field and made their way to the hotel which she said it was just a very scary moment because people were just, you know, they wanted to see these astronauts, hear these celebrities that came back from the moon. And they wanted a picture of them or just a glimpse of them.  Host: Everybody was going nuts. Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: They were. Yeah they had space fever, you know?  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And when they went to Bombay in India, she said a lot of people from the embassy didn't go out but they estimated there were about a million and a half people who were there just to see the astronauts.  Host: Wow. Huge country. Huge population.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, huge crowds. Yeah.  Host: Yeah huge crowd.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. And then she said when they went to the Congo which is a very different story from when they went to Senegal, she said that there was a lot, a lot more crowd control there because the president had put in place these police officers with whips. So if somebody tried to step out and go to the plane or get in front of an astronaut car or try and open the door a whip would come down on them and they'd scurry back to the sidewalk or the location that they were supposed to be at. Like kind of scary.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Imagine like seeing that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. She said that the place that they ended up staying was outside of town. It was near a private zoo that the president owned and you could actually hear the animals at night, the wild animals. So, you know there's some interesting stories from there. Probably the other interesting story she told was when they went to Tehran they were actually able to see the jewels that the Shah had. And they were locked away behind glass and so they told them don't touch the glass with your forehead or your hands. It'll create a huge problem. Then of course somebody didn't follow directions and so doors-- alarms went off, doors started shutting. They managed to get everybody out in time but, you know, that was probably another scary moment.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: I mean these stories are incredible, the ones Geneva is telling. But I can just imagine trying to-- because she's the secretary, she's part of the organization of this--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: trying to come up with alternate routes if you're getting broken up and now you have to deal with okay now the doors are closing on us and alarms are going off, what do we do? That had to be one of the most stressful like tours that you could possibly go on with that many people just so excited in every single place you go. And I think that's one of the great things about this mission is how it captivated the whole world. I know-- I think it's in the book \"Marketing the Moon\", I forget exactly the number so this might not be a good thing to quote but I'll do it anyway, is I think 95% of the world's televisions were tuned into the moon landing I believe. Everybody was. Now again this is a time when there was three channels but you know it's, it was one of those things where everybody was tuned in. So naturally everyone would be excited and all the papers would say man landed on the moon. And it was for all of mankind too so everyone was engaging with it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yes.  Host: It was just a wonderful thing.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: I mean the United States accomplished this goal but I think the whole world saw it as an opportunity as Neil Armstrong said-- a giant leap for mankind. He didn't say it was a giant leap for the United States of America.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. And that was intentional, right? They thought about that ahead of time.   [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Hope you really enjoyed these stories from Dr. Ross-Nazzal. It was some great stuff. And thanks for sticking around. We have a few more stories to tell but these will be told by the people who actually experienced them. At the beginning I mentioned we made a video at Rice Stadium very recently and had a chance to pull aside some alumni of the Apollo Program who had some interesting stories. So, here they are. I hope you enjoy. First is George Fletcher who actually experienced John F. Kennedy's speech at Rice Stadium.  [ Transition Sound ]  George Fletcher: Okay I'm George Fletcher. I was about in the 7th grade when we were sitting in class and all of the sudden the teacher comes running into the classroom, everybody up, everybody up. And so we all got up. They hustled us out to the bus and we got on the bus and somewhere along the line we learned we were going to go listen to the president. Okay, fine. So we went out to Rice Stadium and they had us come off the bus, get into the stands, and we all sat prim and proper just like we'd always been taught and we listened to the president. Well I say we listened, I was in the 7th grade and so I wasn't all that excited about what he had to say, at least not at that point in time, but we listened politely. And it was hot. It was very hot. And after it was over, we got back on the bus and had to go back to school. But it was a very exciting time because when I look back on it and see the importance of what he was saying at that time, and then for me to graduate from school and go to work in the space program, it means a lot more to me now that I was there. I appreciate being there.  Interviewer: So what did you in the space program? Tell me about your adult life?  George Fletcher: I worked-- started out as a quality engineer but transitioned over to systems safety and I've been in systems safety for nearly 40 years.  Interviewer: So were you a NASA contractor or--?  George Fletcher: Contractor, yes.  Interviewer: Okay.  George Fletcher: And I started out, the last four days-- I came to the center on the last four days of Skylab 4 and after that I went through the ASTP program, went through the complete shuttle program, did some with space station, and now I'm back doing Orion.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Here's Don Whalen who actually worked on all the unmanned and manned missions of the Apollo Program.  [ Transition Sound ]  Interviewer: What was your technical expertise?  Don Whalen: The Environmental Control System. I worked on the-- it's called the ECS, the Environmental Control System on the command module for Apollo. And we, you know, worked on the design, development, test, certification, and mission readiness for the system.  Interviewer: Now I don't want you to get like mad about astronauts, but talk about the people behind the scenes. You know you see all these movies and you always see the, you know, Tom Hanks doesn't play you. [laughs] How many people, you know, go into all that amazing stuff that happens and is in front of the cameras and, you know, the going to the moon and all this? How many people go behind the scenes and what's the importance of the workers behind all that stuff?  Don Whalen: Well the workers behind the scenes is what gets the job done. We were in the engineering directorate. Unfortunately all you hear, a lot of the people hear, is mission control. But we wouldn't have had any missions without us in engineering designing, development, and certifying the system to keep them living. So we worked hand in hand with the guys in mission control, but it seems like that's all the general public knows is mission control. [laughs]  Interviewer: Yeah. Seems like they need somebody like you designing environmental systems for a moon base.  Don Whalen: [Laughs] They've probably already got something in mind already you know? But, yeah no we work, we work with the contractors. You know AIR Research out in Downy, out in California, designed the environmental control system for the command module. So, and then we used to take trips out there. The unfortunate thing that is always in my mind is the Apollo 1 fire. And I had just left mission control working with the guys and on the way home that's when it happened. So we had a lot of going through to do and, you know, get ready again. It was an unfortunate situation.  Interviewer: The timeline for getting, for you know failures and then getting somebody on the moon. At the time was it an unbelievable task what y’all were doing, because that's the way it's kind of described, you know, when you hear about the history of it.  Don Whalen: Yeah well we were zeroed in on our subsystem. That was our job, to get it ready. Everybody el- all the other subsystems were in the same boat. All this stuff about beating Russia to the moon and all was at the upper levels and they were controlling what we did, but it was our job to get our subsystem ready and certified for flight. And that's what we did.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Here's Gary Evans and Jim Kelly, both of whom were EECOM and were reunited at this video shoot.   [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. I'm just going to ask you a couple questions. First, when you were invited to come to this event to film at Rice Stadium with all of these Apollo alumni, current JSC employees, and even current astronauts, what really drew you to come today?  Gary Evans: It seemed like a good idea.  Jim Kelly: Yeah.   Gary Evans: We got a lot of things coming up and there's going to be a lot of media building up for that so I thought I'd support this. I'm really curious to see how the film's going to look from perspective of being on the field with all the people. It was a lot of fun. Lot of fun. It was good to see the people too. Lot of friends here today.  Host: It's like a reunion.  Jim Kelly: I was kind of just enjoying recognition for a lot of old folks that did a good job back then that have probably long been forgotten.  Gary Evans: Yes.  Jim Kelly: There's a-- it was a lot of hard work, a lot of people and I just came down hopefully to see some of my old buddies. I found one by the way. [laughs] Gary and I worked together for quite a few times.  Host: What were you doing then? What were you working on during the Apollo program?  Jim Kelly: Both of us were flight controllers. We were in the Mission Control Center and we both supported the position EECOM.  Host: What were some of the highlights of your time as EECOM?  Gary Evans: EECOM? Well it was, the whole ride was 40 years and a week so it started a long time ago and just to be there and to participate in support was more than anybody would ever expect. We were the luckiest people around to get the opportunity.  Host: Do you remember where you were during the Apollo moon landing?  Jim Kelly: Yes. On console. I was one of the few that followed the flight plan rather than a mission schedule. My sys- one of my systems expertise besides the electrical communication and instrumentation and sequential systems was the docking system. So I was there in the event that they aborted the landing and we had to re-dock. In the event that we had a problem I was the resident docking specialist for hardware.  Host: And how about you Gary?  Gary Evans: I was still in California. I had been here during the Gemini Program and supported a lot of the EVAs and the hardware. We built the umbilical and the chest pack for that so I had known a lot of the people in building seven-- the crew systems division-- and I'd been supporting Apollo for the entire time also. So we worked a lot of integration but I was busy working on something on the west coast.  Host: Can you tell me do you remember where you were during JFK's speech?  Jim Kelly: Yeah I was still in high school.  Host: Really?  Jim Kelly: Yeah. I was sitting out-- my father was military and we were stationed in Germany and we'd just got back from our German assignment and I was in my senior year of high school and that's where I was and lord and behold, a couple of years later I was just one of them.  Gary Evans: And I was working in California still on the Environmental Control System for Apollo and for Gemini which was still going at the time. And JFK did something for us also. Some of us were on the critical path for getting to the moon and they went out and saw that we didn't have to get, to go to Vietnam. They kind of I guess protected us where we ended up on a list, a bunch of us, and we were fortunate to do that.  Host: Wonderful.  Gary Evans: So, it was a, he was a smart man but he was really ready to go and he got everybody fired up, I'll tell you. It was a good thing. It was good times.  Host: Now last thing, those badges are pretty interesting. Can you tell me what they mean?  Jim Kelly: Mine's a mission badge for Apollo 11 I wore. It gave me access to the control center. So I've got one of these from GT 76 all the way through the Soyuz Mission. I was a mission controller.  Host: How about yours Gary?  Gary Evans: I worked for Rockwell International at the time and I worked for Apollo 16, 15, 14, 17, so I supported those in Mission Control as a life support in the background.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Lastly, here's Reuben Taylor. He was one of the managers for the ascent propulsion system on the lunar module and has a great story of how critical that component was.  [ Transition Sound ]  Reuben Taylor: I was, I came to Houston to be one of the managers for the ascent propulsion system on the lunar module. I came to Houston in 1964 and so we worked the system all the way up through the last Apollo landing. And one of the interesting things that-- Neil Armstrong, before we ever went to land on the moon, called over said hey would you come over, I want to talk to you about redesigning the engines. And what he wanted us to do was to put in manual valves to start the engine in case he didn't have electrical power. And I said well that's a tough order. So I said if you're concerned about the-- not having electrical power, well we've got electrical strings coming in from multiple sources so we're not really concerned about power. But in addition, if you do lose power, you've got to have power for the reaction control systems which stabilize you as you're coming off the moon. And so it's, there's a lot here that you're asking us to do. I didn't tell him but we were also on a tight schedule and it was not really a very practical thing to do because our rocket engines started up in like three tenths of a second we were almost 100% power. So after listening me out he says okay, thanks for coming over and the end of conversation. [laughs] So we did not have to go redesign the engine. The thing about the ascent propulsion system, it was the only component on the entire Apollo program that did not have a backup, okay? If that engine failed, that's it. The guys stay on the moon. We had one engine, no backup system. That engine had to fire up and we used hypergolic propellants. It was no spark plugs or anything to start. No igniters. You mixed the propellants and they automatically start to burn. And the thing about Apollo 13 was I was home getting ready to go to bed, it was about 10:30 o'clock and one of my co-workers called me and says hey you better come up here, we've got a problem. [laughs] And so I went up there and found out that the guys were transferring into the lunar module and, to make it around, all the way around the moon and back. So I had an interesting time here at NASA and I retired in 1987 and just had a blast.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: These, Jennifer, are absolutely fascinating stories. And I think I'm going to kind of reiterate that point that was, you know, we see a lot when we think about Apollo 11, you know we like to look at Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin. We like to look at Gene Kranz which were, you know, astounding figures in the history. And I was so excited to dive into some of the lesser known stories. This was absolutely fascinating, so I appreciate you coming on Jennifer to tell these wonderful, wonderful stories. This was very exciting.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, it's my pleasure. And I hope if folks are interested they'll go out and look at the oral histories. Like I said we've got over 1,000 on the website and there's a lot of material out there, great material waiting to be mined.  Host: Wow. Please do.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Thank you so much.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey thanks for sticking around. Once again and so we can sort of tie the bow on this episode, we are in the middle of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo missions. Of course today's episode being just before the landing on the—the historic landing on the moon, July 20th 1969, 50 years later. So if you want to see other things that we are doing here on \"Houston We Have a Podcast\", we have a page for that, NASA.gov/Johnson/HWHAP/Apollo50th. We are putting all of our Apollo episodes from various Apollo missions and collecting them, including some of these lesser known stories, a lot of which we explored today. If you want to know more just about the Apollo 50th, go to NASA.gov/specials/Apollo50th. Lots of resources. Lots of history that you can just peruse. And if you are listening to some of the podcasts here on \"Houston We Have a Podcast\", and that's still not enough for you, we have other NASA podcasts and you can go to NASA.gov/podcast to go find those. I know specifically Gravity Assist, NASA in Silicon Valley, Rocket Ranch and a new NASA podcast called NASA Explores Apollo from the Goddard Space Flight Center are doing some special episodes around the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 and you should check those out. Otherwise we're going to be talking about it all across our social media platforms so head to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and check out some of the NASA pages that we have for you and some of the Apollo 50th content. Use the hashtag #askNASA on any one of those platforms to submit an idea for the show. And if you'd like to bring it on here, just make sure to mention it's for \"Houston We Have a Podcast\".
